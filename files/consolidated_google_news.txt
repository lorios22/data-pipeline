Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Price: Trader Warns of Correction as BTC Dominance Reaches 2021 Levels
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Solana’s SOL and ecosystem memecoins, such as popcat (POPCAT), led crypto market gains on Thursday, with bitcoin (BTC) and majors mostly flat. A bitcoin trader believes the rising dominance rate for suggests short-term bearishness. BTC added under 1% in the past 24 hours, with majors ether (ETH), BNB Chain (BNB), xrp (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) showing mixed price action. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, rose 0.43%. Last week, a widely tracked bitcoin dominance indicator reached over 57% on CoinMarketCap, to its highest level since April 2021. Dominance refers to the ratio between the market capitalization of BTC to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined and is often used as a gauge for market sentiment. High dominance might indicate that bitcoin is leading the market, which can be seen when investors prefer the relative stability and established nature of bitcoin over the higher risk associated with altcoins. Conversely, a decrease in bitcoin's dominance might suggest that investors are moving their capital into altcoins, potentially signaling the start of an “altcoin season.” “Ethereum continues to lose market share to bitcoin and other altcoins. As a result, BTC’s share of all cryptocurrency capitalization has risen to 57.3%, the highest since April 2021,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro told CoinDesk in an email. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean an upward trend for the top cryptocurrency, which has pulled back below $67K, losing 1% in the last day and nearly 4% from its peak on 21 October. “The price is now close to a local support level at $66.8K. A break of this support will open the way for a deeper correction to $65.5K, near the 61.8% retracement level from the last rally and the late September top,” Kuptsikevich warned. SOL jumped 5% to $173 in the past 24 hours, extending weekly gains to 14% as it reached price levels last seen in early August. SOL set a record high against ether, as reported, while, network-based memecoins POPCAT, BONK and GOAT rose as much as 70% amid a bump in network volumes and trading activity. The Solana ecosystem is a flourishing hotbed for trading activity for its engaged community and prevalence of small-cap trading - where frenzied memecoins trend often last a few weeks that boosts SOL prices. Artificial intelligence-themed memecoins are the current flavor of the week, where projects claiming to have AI tools are driving trading narratives on the network. That pushed revenues and token issuances on the Solana token deployer Pump to record highs earlier this week. Active addresses grew to 85,000, of which 37,000 were new wallets, indicative of strong demand. A Pump-connected fee account sold over $6 million worth of SOL late Monday, taking its lifetime sales to over $78 million or 500,000 SOL. Over 40,000 new tokens were created on Solana in the past 24 hours, SolanaFloor data shows. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Title: $222 Million in Bitcoin (BTC) Shift Hands as Price Nears $67,000

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available. Bitcoin (BTC) whales have started to increase their activity as optimism prevails on the broader crypto market. Earlier today, $222 million worth of BTC were shifted between unknown wallets, sparking speculations in the community about potential market activity. Whale Alert, a crypto monitoring service that tracks significant token transfers, revealed that 3,326 BTC, valued at approximately $222.3 million, were moved between two unidentified wallets. This has reignited discussions about potential price swings as whales — large holders of Bitcoin — make strategic moves. Whale transactions of this magnitude often signal an underlying shift in the overall sentiment or preparation for significant price action. With the price of Bitcoin nearing $67,000, many are speculating that these transfers could be part of a broader accumulation phase by whales, anticipating a price breakout. At the time of writing, BTC is priced at $66,958.34, marking a slight 0.72% increase over the last 24 hours. Furthermore, the market is showing signs of bullish activity, as evidenced by the 19.23% rise in trading volume over the same period, reaching a whopping $33.54 billion. This spike in trading volume shows increased buying activity, which could further drive the BTC price upward if sustained. The crypto market as a whole is also riding the wave of optimism as traders look forward to positive macroeconomic changes and broader sentiment shifts on financial markets. Whales have a history of timing their trades around key market movements, and large transfers often precede substantial price shifts. These investors tend to make moves in anticipation of or in response to significant market changes, which can influence smaller investors to follow suit. Bitcoin’s recent price action, combined with increased trading volumes and whale movements, points to a growing sense of optimism on the market. Analysts are monitoring these trends closely as the coin approaches the psychological threshold of $67,000. A break above this level could trigger further buying pressure, potentially pushing the price to new all-time highs (ATHs).

Title: $200,000 Bitcoin by 2025? Bernstein sees a bullish future for BTC - AMBCrypto
Date: October 24, 2024
Content:
From its current price levels, Bitcoin is looking at an 198.51% appreciation in the upcoming year.  After the ‘Uptober’ rally took the market by storm,  Bitcoin’s [BTC] price has experienced a slight dip. However, analysts at Bernstein Research remain optimistic, issuing a bullish forecast for the cryptocurrency. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, shared key insights from Bernstein’s report titled “From Coin to Compute: The Bitcoin Investing Guide” on X.  The report projects Bitcoin to reach an ambitious target of $200,000 by next year.  Analysts Gautam Chhugani, Mahika Sapra, and Sanskar Chindalia identified key factors driving their price target for BTC, stating: “The new institutional era, in our view, could push Bitcoin to a high of $200,000 by the end of 2025.” Worth noting that the king coin has appreciated by around 110% over the past year, according to CoinMarketCap.  At the time of writing, its market capitalization stood at $1.3 trillion, comprising over half of the total global crypto market cap of $2.32 trillion. Bernstein’s extensive 160-page “Black Book” emphasized the significant role institutional investors are playing in Bitcoin’s present and future growth. According to the report, ten global asset managers now hold over $60 billion in BTC through regulated exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This marked a sharp rise from just $12 billion in September 2022.  Moreover, Bitcoin ETFs have seen one of the most successful rollouts in ETF history, attracting $21 billion in inflows year-to-date. AMBCrypto recently reported that the top BTC ETF, IBIT, has surpassed Vanguard’s VTI, taking third place in YTD flows. In light of this substantial institutional interest, Bernstein’s report highlighted: “By the end of 2024, we expect Wall Street to replace Satoshi as the top Bitcoin wallet.” Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, also shared this sentiment. For reference, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, is believed to hold around 1.1 million BTC. With massive accumulation,  institutional Bitcoin ETFs are quickly catching up to this number. In addition to institutional adoption, the report shines a spotlight on the mining industry, which is expected to recover following the April 2024 halving event.  It noted that leading U.S. miners are consolidating their market share and emerging as key energy infrastructure players for AI data centers. Bernstein’s report forecasts that by 2027, more than 20% of U.S. Bitcoin mining power could be dedicated to AI, with smaller miners driving this shift.  Furthermore, revenue from the Bitcoin mining hardware industry is projected to reach over $20 billion over the next five years. Source: Matthew Sigel/X Meanwhile, Chhugani, one of the report’s lead analysts, referred to the $200,000 Bitcoin price prediction as a “conservative estimate,” citing the rising U.S. debt levels.  With the national debt surpassing $35 trillion, Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it an increasingly attractive store of value. Previously, high-profile investors like Paul Tudor Jones also advocated for Bitcoin as an inflation hedge.  Amid the backdrop of these factors, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by 2025 seems increasingly plausible.    Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: BRICS Summit Kicks Off As Lawmakers Discuss Using Bitcoin (BTC) To Evade US Sanctions: Report - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
Russian officials are reportedly discussing how to use Bitcoin (BTC) to conduct international trade outside the purview of the US dollar system. According to a Bloomberg report shared by VanEck’s head of digital assets Matthew Sigel, top lawmakers are pushing the idea that Russian mining firms could sell their BTC to international buyers, who would then use the coins to pay for imports and effectively bypass sanctions. Russia has already made several moves this year to sanctions-proof its economy, including permitting the use of cryptocurrency for international trade, and working on the launch of its own crypto exchanges and stablecoins. At a BRICS Business Forum held last week, Russian crypto-mining firm BitRiver says it discussed a partnership with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the country’s sovereign wealth fund. The partnership includes using BitRiver’s data centers to increase Russia’s share in the artificial intelligence (AI) economy and global computing power market and to build data centers in BRICS countries. Says Igor Runets, owner and CEO of BitRiver, “Mining is not just the foundation for the digital economy. If Russia catches up with the United States in such a fundamental branch of the digital economy as mining, this means that our country cannot be ignored. This is further economic growth, liquidity for settlements with our partners, the foundation for the development of artificial intelligence, the creation of highly skilled jobs throughout the country.  Together with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, we will focus on creating an infrastructure base based on mining – building data centers and connecting them to the necessary capacities so that it is possible to deploy and implement projects related to AI, and thus develop this area on a national scale.” BRICS was originally established as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, but recently welcomed Iran, Egypt Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates, and has received requests from other countries to join.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Spot Price Nears All-Time High Amidst Market Resurgence - Blockchain.News
Date: Date not available

 Oct 23, 2024 17:03
 Bitcoin's spot price surges towards $69k, nearing its all-time high, as on-chain metrics and rising futures interest signal a potential market revival. Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied significantly, with its spot price climbing to $69,000, just 6.8% shy of its all-time high (ATH), according to Glassnode Insights. This recent uptick marks a breakthrough of several critical technical and on-chain pricing levels, indicating a positive shift in market momentum since the lull observed in late June. The recent surge in Bitcoin's price is reminiscent of the 2021 up-cycle, differing from the downturns of 2019 and 2022. The market has broken through resistance levels, including the 200-day moving average (DMA) and the 111DMA, which are pivotal points for investors. The 365-day simple moving average (SMA) continues to act as a significant support level, particularly evident during the yen-carry trade unwind in August. Bitcoin's price movement has also been confined between the ATH and the -23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, showcasing an unusual period of sideways trading. This stability is atypical, as Bitcoin generally either reaches new ATHs or sees significant sell-offs. On-chain analysis reveals that net capital inflows into Bitcoin have increased by $21.8 billion over the past month, pushing the Realized Cap to a new ATH of $646 billion. This influx suggests a rise in liquidity and sustained capital support for Bitcoin's price. The AVIV Ratio, a key on-chain metric, indicates robust investor profitability, with active investors maintaining their cost basis effectively. The current trading environment suggests a transition from an enthusiastic to a euphoric bull market, as Bitcoin attempts to surpass the 2021 ATH of $69,000. The Bitcoin futures market has seen a significant increase in open interest, reaching a new ATH of $32.9 billion. This growth is largely attributed to increased activity at the CME Group, where institutional investors are utilizing fixed-term futures contracts to engage in cash-and-carry strategies. Despite the rise in open interest, trading volumes across futures contracts remain subdued compared to the peak levels seen in March. This suggests a dominance of arbitrage and basis strategies over pure speculative trading. The cash-and-carry trade offers a yield of approximately 9.6%, nearly double the returns from short-term US Treasuries, making it an attractive option for institutional traders. This trend is expected to continue as further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are anticipated. The recent rally in Bitcoin's spot price, coupled with increased futures market activity, suggests a renewed bullish sentiment in the crypto market. Institutional interest, particularly in regulated futures products, is growing, potentially leading to sustained market liquidity and further price gains. 10/24/2024 12:35:23 PM 10/24/2024 12:16:43 PM 10/24/2024 12:00:00 PM 10/24/2024 10:11:39 AM 10/24/2024 10:00:02 AM Email us at info@blockchain.news Welcome to your premier source for the latest in AI, cryptocurrency, blockchain, and AI search tools—driving tomorrow's innovations today.

Date: Date not available
Content:
Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, managed to remain stable within the $67,000 range early Thursday. Other popular altcoins — including the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) — saw a mix of gains and dips across the board as the overall Market Fear & Greed Index stood at 52 (Neutral) out of 100, as per CoinMarketCap data. Memecoin Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) became the biggest gainer with a 24-hour jump of nearly 26 percent. ApeCoin (APE) remained the top loser for the third consecutive day, with a 24-hour loss of nearly 9 percent.  The global crypto market cap stood at $2.32 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.12 percent. Bitcoin price stood at $67,312.47, registering a 24-hour loss of 0.71 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchanges, BTC price stood at Rs 58.06 lakh. ETH price stood at $2,551.76, marking a 24-hour dip of 2.26 percent at the time of writing. Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 2.30 lakh. DOGE registered a 24-hour jump of 1.34 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.1405. Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 12.45. Litecoin saw a 24-hour jump of 1.60 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $70.26. LTC price in India stood at Rs 6,223.45. XRP price stood at $0.5311, seeing a 24-hour gain of 0.38 percent. Ripple price in India stood at Rs 46.04. Solana price stood at $172.96, marking a 24-hour jump of 5.18 percent. SOL price in India stood at Rs 14,312.59.  As per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours: Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) Price: $0.706224-hour gain: 25.91 percent Popcat (SOL) (POPCAT) Price: $1.6324-hour gain: 17.23 percent cat in a dogs world (MEW) Price: $0.0104524-hour gain: 15.17 percent Juptier (JUP) Price: $1.0724-hour gain: 10.16 percent dogwifhat (WIF) Price: $2.5624-hour gain: 6.51 percent As per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours: ApeCoin (APE) Price: $1.1824-hour loss: 8.71 percent Beam (BEAM) Price: $10.0182824-hour loss: 5.43 percent Flare (FLR) Price: $0.0140324-hour loss: 4.40 percent Axie Infinity (AXS) Price: $5.04 24-hour loss: 4.17 percent Aptos (APT) Price: $10.0824-hour loss: 3.36 percent Mudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, “Bitcoin is stabilising at $67,200 after dipping to a low of $65,200, while Ethereum dropped 2.5%, currently trading at $2,550. The sell-off was largely driven by a 400-point drop in the Dow Jones, mirroring weakness in the traditional markets. Adding to the pressure, Trump’s Polymarket odds slipped from 65% to 63%, creating a negative sentiment in the market. Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $67,500, with support holding firm at $65,950.” CoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, “Yesterday, Bitcoin experienced a notable decline, dropping from around $66,000 to a low of $65,260. This downturn coincided with negative performance in the SPY and Nasdaq. However, Bitcoin quickly rebounded, climbing back up to $67,300, suggesting it may have found a local bottom. If it breaks yesterday's low, the next support level to watch is $64,000. Notably, the Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of $198.5 Million, signalling institutional demand.” Avinash Shekhar, Co-founder & CEO, Pi42, said, “Bitcoin's key support level at $66,600 needs to hold to continue bullish momentum a breakdown can revive the scenario seen in previous drops which could be a bearish trend at $55,000 for a confirmed bullish momentum, BTC must rise above $70,500. Ethereum too has issues as recent weakness has driven prices down 9.6% from October 20 to October 23, even as increasing transaction fees have dropped people's incentives, making it lag behind in comparison with the greater market. The volumes on Ethereum DEXs fell by 13% across the reporting period and also suffered a net lock drop indicating a decline in interest. Moreover, uncertainty about the Prague-Electra network upgrade hangs over the near-term horizon as there is fear it may not find a difficult solution to blocking on the network where Ether's prospects of long-term growth depend. Market sentiments are neutral. Today on Thursday, the total global market capitalization hit $2.31 trillion, marking a 0.15% decrease over the last day.”  Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, “Bitcoin is currently stabilizing around $67,000, with bullish sentiment potentially attracting institutional interest. The cryptocurrency is showing notable volatility, testing support levels and exhibiting a mixed trend. Recent inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs indicate growing confidence in the market. A recent breakout above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average at $67,250 could signal further upward momentum, with immediate resistance at $67,900. However, traders should remain cautious of bearish pressures, with key support levels at $65,230 and $63,760. Overall, the market's resilience suggests potential for continued interest and price movement in Bitcoin.” Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, “In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen a modest uptick, with Bitcoin (BTC) rising by 0.32% to reach $67,224. Notably, Solana (SOL) outperformed with a significant gain of 5.27%, showcasing resilience within the sector. Investors anticipate that the upcoming U.S. election may create further volatility, yet there is optimism for recovery in November. Investors are still hoping for a cryptocurrency recovery as sentiment stabilizes and possible regulatory clarity appears.”  Subscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive Disclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Is Going to $80K Regardless of Who Wins U.S. Elections, Traders Say
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Bitcoin (BTC) may cross previous highs in the coming weeks regardless of which candidate becomes the U.S. president, some traders say, in a shift of tone ahead of the November elections. Traders have long perceived Republican Donald Trump’s victory as a bullish catalyst for the industry for his pro-crypto stance and promises to make the U.S. a bitcoin powerhouse. Democrat Kamala Harris, on the other hand, has not made similar promises but said he would introduce regulations to protect certain groups. Such stances have skewed expectations of a Republican win as better for bitcoin. However, some say the asset is poised to go higher either way as several macroeconomic factors weigh in. “Both Presidential candidates have adopted pro-crypto stances to appeal to voters, but it's tough to say if any of their promises will come to pass,” Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “However, It is clear that the market is responding positively to the upcoming change in administration and policies - whether it's Harris or Trump, traders and investors think any sort of change will be good.” “The fact that this coincides with the first Fed rate cuts in four years and a recent run-up in stock prices only adds to the thesis that Bitcoin could surpass its all-time high and reach $80,000,” Mei added. Options traders are already increasing bets that bitcoin will touch fresh highs by the end of November, as previously reported. The implied volatility for bitcoin options due around election day is elevated. The open interest for call options expiring on November 29 shows a significant concentration at the $80,000 strike price, followed by a notable interest at the $70,000 level. For call options with expiration on December 27, the open interest is primarily grouped around the $100,000 and $80,000 strike prices. Options due to expire on November 8 have their highest open interest at the $75,000 strike price, indicating a key market focus area for that period. However, some are terming the price behavior as an election hedge rather than a bullish outlook. “I wouldn't say that people buying 80K calls on BTC to be a bet on higher prices, but is more like a cheap option (implied vol really hasn't gone up that much) against a broader market rally,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “BTC vol skews heavily in favor of higher prices post election, but that has been the case for quite a few weeks now as an election 'hedge,” Fan added. BTC is down 0.7% over the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, outperforming a 1.6% drop in the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20). Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Title: Bitcoin mining difficulty hits ATH: Here's how it could impact BTC prices - AMBCrypto
Date: October 24, 2024
Content:
Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has reached a new peak, driven by a rising hashrate as miners compete for rewards.   Bitcoin [BTC] mining difficulty has reached a record high, driven by a surge in the network’s hashrate. This increase occurs as Bitcoin’s price rises, prompting miners to expand their operations to capitalize on the potential rewards.  The higher mining difficulty is a reflection of the network’s growing security, but also presents challenges for miners as they face rising costs. Throughout 2024, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been steadily increasing. As of mid-October, it reached a peak of 656.3 billion, indicating heightened mining activity on the network.   A higher hashrate means more miners are joining the Bitcoin network, competing for blocks. Source: CryptoQuant The primary motivation for miners is BTC’s ongoing price rally, which has encouraged them to ramp up their computational power.  With BTC trading at around $67,193, the incentive to secure new blocks has grown. However, this has also led to an automatic adjustment in the network’s mining difficulty. Bitcoin mining difficulty has climbed to its highest level ever following the surge in hashrate. The network automatically adjusts mining difficulty every two weeks to ensure blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes.  As more miners join the network, competition intensifies, increasing difficulty and the costs associated with mining.

While BTC’s rising price provides potential rewards, it also raises the cost of securing those rewards, squeezing profit margins for many miners. Alongside the rise in the Bitcoin mining difficulty and hashrate, miner fees have shown a moderate increase. Fees typically rise when there’s a surge in network activity, with miners prioritizing transactions that offer higher rewards.  Although miner fees have spiked during network congestion in 2024, block rewards continue to account for the bulk of miners’ income. Source: Glassnode Despite these network adjustments, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable, currently trading at $67,193, down by 0.28%.  Read Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2024-25 The Average True Range (ATR) indicator points to potential volatility in the short term, suggesting that BTC’s price could see fluctuations as the mining ecosystem adjusts to the increased difficulty and network activity. As Bitcoin mining difficulty and hashrate continue to climb, the interplay between miner profitability, fees, and BTC’s price will be essential to monitor.    Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Trader Peter Brandt Says Bitcoin and Two Altcoins Flashing Interesting Price Developments – Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
Seasoned trader Peter Brandt believes that Bitcoin (BTC) and two additional crypto assets including Ethereum (ETH) are showing signs of strength. Brandt tells his 744,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin continues to trade within a consolidation pattern. While the trader shares a chart suggesting that BTC has broken above the resistance of the pattern, he notes Bitcoin will officially be in bull territory only after clearing its all-time high close to $74,000. “[The] seven-month inverted expanding triangle continues to form. The sequence of lower highs and lower lows from Mar 2024 has NOT yet been violated. Long Bitcoin is my single largest speculative position.”  At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $67,363. Moving on to Ethereum, the trader says ETH has broken out of a bullish reversal pattern on the daily chart. “ETH closing price chart inverted H&S (head and shoulders) pattern. I am flat in ETH.” Traders typically view an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern as bullish, suggesting that buyers are no longer waiting for the price to revisit the lows before entering the market. At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $2,622. The last crypto asset on the trader’s radar is the Ethereum challenger Solana (SOL). According to Brandt, SOL is flashing a cup and handle pattern, a structure suggesting that an asset is taking a breather before moving higher. “SOL displays possible cup and handle with rectangle as handle. I am flat in this crypto.” At time of writing, SOL is worth $166.40. Brandt notes that Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are among the “most interesting chart developments” he sees right now. Other charts on his list include Silver and Bitcoin versus gold. Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox

Title: On Derive's Options Market, Institution Takes $25M Hedge Bet on BTC Price Action Spurred by U.S. Election
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by As the U.S. election nears, increased betting and hedging tied to the political event, is powering notable increases in trading volumes in the crypto market. The election will have far-reaching consequences for the crypto regulatory space in the world's largest economy. Early this week, the decentralized derivatives exchange Derive saw an institution take a multi-legged bitcoin (BTC) options strategy, betting on a continued move higher in BTC after the Nov. 5 election. The trade generated a notional trading volume of $25 million, the largest ever onchain options transaction bet tied to the U.S. election, Derive told CoinDesk in an email. The institution acquired 100 call option contracts with a $70,000 strike price set to expire on Nov. 29 while simultaneously writing or selling 200 contracts of the $80,000 call and 100 contracts of the $50,000 put, both expiring on Nov. 29. The institution deposited eBTC, restaked bitcoin created via EtherFi, as collateral, ensuring it earns passive yields on the same. The strategy, which looks like a ratio call spread funded by a short put position, will profit most if bitcoin rallies to $80,000 by Nov. 29. The positioning is consistent with options flows on centralized exchanges, which indicate expectations for a post-election rally to $80,000 and higher. "This $25 million options trade marks a watershed moment for onchain options trading, and it's one that could have significant implications post-election. The institution has strategically positioned a unique structure with sold puts, bought calls, and eBTC collateral, potentially standing to make $1,020,000 on the structure if BTC hits $80,000 by November 29 – excluding any gains from the eBTC collateral," Nick Forster, co-founder of Derive told CoinDesk in an email. "The trade is a prime example of how onchain options offer scalable, non-correlated yield for any onchain asset," Forster added. Derive is the largest onchain options platform, accounting for 32% of the total DEX options volume of $339 million in the past 24 hours, according to DeFiLlama. The onchain market, however, is still relatively small compared to Deribit and other centralized platforms, which boast a cumulative 24-hour volume of several billion dollars.

Title: ‘I'm long Bitcoin’: Hedge fund manager on BTC’s appeal as an inflation hedge - AMBCrypto
Date: October 24, 2024
Content:
The exec stressed that cash holdings in his portfolio are short-term, favoring inflation-resistant assets.  In a recent interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, billionaire hedge fund manager, Paul Tudor Jones, outlined his strategy for navigating inflation.  The veteran highlighted his focus on assets like gold, Bitcoin [BTC], commodities, and Nasdaq tech stocks while steering clear of fixed-income investments. He stated, “I’m long gold, I’m long Bitcoin.”  Jones explained that his portfolio is designed to benefit from inflationary trends, drawing on examples such as Japan, where inflation outpaces interest rates.  Worth noting that both gold and Bitcoin have showcased strong performances this year, underscoring their roles in inflation-hedging strategies. Gold reached an all-time high (ATH) of over $2,750 per ounce on the 23rd of October. This rise was driven by the upcoming U.S. elections, the Middle East conflict, and expectations of further monetary easing. According to Business Insider, the asset has appreciated by 33% this year. Meanwhile, the king coin also posted triple-digit gains over the past year. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin was up by over 117%. At press time, it sat just 9.8% below its March ATH.  Jones’ comments sparked interesting reactions from the Bitcoin community, where enthusiasts often promote the coin as an inflation hedge. One such enthusiast was Anthony Pompliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management.  He emphasized Jones’ insight into how younger investors are turning to the Nasdaq as an alternative hedge against inflation, in contrast to traditional assets.  The CEO added his own observation, stating,  “Finally we can admit that the stock market goes up because of the debasement of the currency.”  This suggested that rising stock prices may not be fueled by organic growth alone.  The hedge fund manager also addressed the United States’ rising national debt. The debt has surged from 40% to 100% of GDP over the past 25 years, now standing at $35.7 trillion.  Moreover, according to J.P. Morgan’s September CPI report, the Consumer Price Index rose by 0.2% MoM and 2.4% YoY.  Compared to the 2.5% YoY rise recorded in August, this indicated a slight decrease. The dip indicated gradual progress toward the FED’s target of 2%. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s report, revealed that U.S. consumers expect median inflation to hover around 3% over the next 12 months.  Jones stated that the only way for a nation to escape such high levels of debt is by inflating its way out of it.  That would involve keeping interest rates below inflation and creating a small tax on consumers. This, combined with nominal growth above inflation, can help reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over time. As inflation remains a persistent challenge, Jones’ multi-asset strategy of incorporating traditional and digital assets continues to attract attention, reflecting how investors are navigating economic uncertainty.    Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Bitcoin Slides to $66K, Ether Dives 5% in Market-Wide Selloff
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Cryptocurrencies bled lower on Wednesday alongside a slide in traditional markets across the board. The CoinDesk 20 – an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and exchange coins – was down 2.6% in the last 24 hours, with Chainlink (LINK) the worst performing, slumping 7.6%. The only project to buck the downtrend was Internet Computer (ICP), which rose 1% Bitcoin (BTC) dipped 2.3% to $66,000, while ether (ETH) tumbled 5.3%, taking its price back under $2,490. Solana (SOL), meanwhile, showed further strength today – at press time, the coin was flat at $169. ETH not only made new lows against BTC – the ETH/BTC ratio went below 0.038 for the first time since April 2021 – but also against SOL. The SOL/ETH trading pair notched a decisive new all-time high by rising 6.3% to 0.068 amid renewed debate in the crypto community about the wisdom behind Ethereum’s roadmap. “Much of the poor sentiment and questions around Ethereum's roadmap is due to recent underperformance versus BTC and SOL,” Brian Rudick, director of research at crypto trading firm GSR, posted on X. “However, this is a poor comparison as BTC and SOL were subject to two large idiosyncratic events,” Rudick wrote, namely, the immense success of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and the impact of the FTX collapse – and Solana’s resurgence from the ashes – on investor perception. “Measuring from crypto's ATH market cap in Nov 2021 to remove [the FTX collapse] shows ETH and SOL have had [about] the same performance,” Rudick added. The looming U.S. election, only two weeks away, didn't appear to offer any assistance either. Even with crypto-friendly Donald Trump in the lead (based on betting markets), and Vice President Kamala Harris appearing less adversarial towards crypto than the current administration, markets will have difficulty “breaking upwards before election day,” Joe Edwards, head of research at digital assets broker Enigma Securities, wrote in a research report. The bleeding out Wednesday wasn’t contained to crypto. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones were each lower by more than 1% shortly before the end of the session as price consolidated following strong runs higher for all over the past couple of months. The bond market was also lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising to a three-month high of 4.25%. Making record highs on seemingly a daily basis of late, gold also pulled back, slipping 1.1% to $2,730 per ounce. The price of oil fell 1.35% to $70.77 per barrel. “Don’t worry folks Tesla will save the market when they report earnings,” Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of crypto investment advisor Lumida Wealth, posted on X. “Overall, I’d say we are closer to the end of this move of pricing in higher for longer… November is looking very good in my view.” Tesla is due to report its quarterly results after this afternoon's market close. Crypto equities felt the brunt of the pullback. Bitcoin miners fared the worst, with MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) each lower by about 5%. Coinbase (COIN) slumped 6% and MicroStrategy (MSTR) slipped 2.5%. Edited by Stephen Alpher.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Poised to Revolutionize Capital Markets, Says Bitfinex Securities - Blockchain.News

 Bitcoin's robust security and programmability could make it the foundation for future capital markets, challenging Ethereum's dominance, according to Bitfinex Securities. Bitcoin (BTC) is increasingly being viewed as a pivotal player in the future of capital markets, according to insights from Bitfinex Securities. With its superior security model and emerging programmability, Bitcoin is positioned to potentially lead the tokenization trend traditionally dominated by Ethereum. Historically, Ethereum has been the frontrunner in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, with a total RWA value on its platform reaching $2 billion, as highlighted by RWA.xyz. However, Jesse Knutson, Head of Operations at Bitfinex Securities, argues that Bitcoin's robust security and evolving programmability features could shift this landscape. The Liquid Network, a Bitcoin side-chain designed for fast and confidential digital asset transactions, exemplifies this potential. Its total value locked (TVL) has surged from $400 million in 2022 to $1.7 billion. Bitcoin's application in real-world finance is already evident. In Latin America, approximately $1 billion in promissory notes have been issued on the Liquid Network. Moreover, the Blockstream Mining Note, a security token, achieved a record RWA payout, returning over 1,200 BTC to investors. Future high-profile projects include El Salvador's plan to issue the 'volcano token' on the Liquid Network, marking the first tokenization of sovereign debt globally. Bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model is another advantage, offering enhanced protection against double-spending and supporting parallel transaction processing. This model simplifies transaction validation and reduces the risk of errors associated with complex smart contracts, making it particularly appealing for financial applications that prioritize security and scalability. Bitcoin's classification as a commodity provides a significant regulatory advantage over other tokenization ecosystems, which often face complex regulatory challenges. This clarity makes Bitcoin an attractive choice for issuers and platforms involved in tokenizing securities and real-world assets. As Bitcoin's ecosystem continues to grow, it is increasingly being recognized not just as a store of value, but as a transformative network capable of powering the future of digital capital markets, according to Bitfinex Securities.

Title: Crypto Ban: India considers adoption of CBDC amid crypto ban
Date: 23 October 2024
Content:
India contemplates banning privately operated digital currencies such as Bitcoin(BTC) and Ether(ETH). To replace these cryptocurrencies, India could adopt a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).  This move reflects several concerns about the risks of decentralized digital assets in India. Additionally, CBDC could provide similar benefits to cryptocurrencies. However, CBDC will offer more control while minimizing risks.  According to Indian regulators, the digital rupee has huge potential to solve the financial innovation problem without compromising economic stability. On the other hand, the state-backed digital currency is supposed to provide a much safer solution. According to ongoing discussions, most regulators in India are inclined towards more stringent measures like banning cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, the names of the involved institutions in such discussions have not been disclosed. The officials feel private cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, pose more risks than benefits. According to one senior government official, CBDC can offer all the benefits of cryptocurrencies without all the risks associated with decentralized assets.  While the crypto ban looms in India, the Reserve Bank of India could be trying to find alternative ways of improving the adoption rate of CBDCs. The central bank has already launched a retail form of its digital rupee among the general public. Nevertheless, its daily volume stands at just 18,000. RBI has introduced offline transactions and other features to improve the use of CBDC. The bank also plans to integrate the digital rupee with the Unified Payments Interface. The RBI believes it will achieve one million daily transactions by the end of 2024. In July this year, Ajay Seth, India’s Secretary of Economic Affairs, provided insight into developing a policy against decentralized assets. Seth declared that an interministerial group, in which the RBI and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) are also participants, is working on a policy paper that will spell out the government’s position on the regulation or banning of cryptocurrencies. The paper was expected to be published this September 2024, but its release has been delayed, leading to uncertainty about the official policy direction. The document will most likely leave room for countries with stricter measures, including a ban, to impose flexibility. India’s relationship with digital currencies has been marked by turmoil in policy reversals. In 2018, the RBI banned all banks from facilitating crypto-related transactions. However, in 2020, the Indian Supreme Court lifted this ban and provided temporary relief to the crypto industry. Despite this victory, the government has shied away from the complete adoption of cryptocurrencies. India’s Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has often called out how dangerous it would be to recognize private cryptocurrencies officially. According to officials, such assets may pose several potential threats to the stable position of national economies. In November 2023, the RBI Governor, Shaktikanta Das, warned of the destabilizing effect of cryptocurrencies. He described CBDCs as a necessary alternative to decentralized digital currencies for the safety they ensure. According to Das, the digital rupee would shield the Indian financial system yet cater to the thirst for digital assets. The final policy call may affect millions of crypto users in India, with possible ramifications on a global level. Generally, regulatory bodies like the IMF and the FSB have called for countries to implement balanced crypto frameworks. However, India seems open to the idea of allowing the adoption of more stringent regulations or even a complete ban. Based on India’s turbulent crypto history, many investors are closely monitoring the country’s crypto ban discussion. A ban on private cryptocurrencies would severely affect crypto exchanges and crypto users in the country. On the other hand, a successful implementation of the digital rupee would mean setting an example for other nations still considering CBDCs. The implications of its stance on cryptocurrencies will affect crypto regulation trends across the world. This might just prove that a ban works, in which case countries with huge crypto markets will follow suit. Additionally, the CBDC adoption in India may shape what future financial infrastructure may look and feel like in the digital era. Why india is so useless always trying to ruin every one earning platform. Grow up Hi , Blockchain news platform. There is no real source of ban attached to your news.

Title: Bitcoin accumulation addresses surge 93% to nearly $194B - Bullish cue? - AMBCrypto
Date: October 23, 2024
Content:
What does the rising BTC accumulation addresses balance mean for the price of the digital asset?   Based on 2024 investors’ behavior, the HODLing strategy seems to have become the most preferable Bitcoin [BTC] investment approach.  According to data by CryptoQuant’s analyst Burak Kesmeci, BTC accumulation addresses now hold 2.9 million coins. That’s worth over $194 billion, a nearly 2x (93%) increase from January holdings.  “In January 2024, these addresses held only 1.5 million Bitcoins, yet within 10 months, that amount nearly doubled. They continue to accumulate patiently and boldly without selling off their holding”  Source: CryptoQuant To put the massive accumulation spree in perspective, in 2018, BTC accumulation addresses only held 100K coins. Fast-forward to the 2021 bull run, the addresses topped 700K coins.   However, Kusmeci noted that real growth occurred in 2024, with a whopping 93% jump from 1.5 million in January to 2.9 million.  Is it a bullish cue, perhaps signaling that holders expected a further BTC price appreciation?   It’s worth noting that the U.S. spot BTC ETFs debuted in January 2024, and the ensuing optimism might have led to the surge in BTC accumulation addresses holding.  As of the 18th of October, the products held 961K BTC, worth over $65 billion.  Source: CryptoQuant The optimism after the approval of the U.S. spot BTC ETF was evident by a surge in U.S. investor demand for the asset in Q1 2024, as shown by the spikes (green) in the Coinbase Premium Index. The renewed optimism saw BTC hit an all-time high (ATH) above $73K in March. Will the trend repeat? 

At the time of writing, the investor interest in Q4 was lower than the huge demand seen in Q1. That said, BTC was valued at $66.3K, about 11% from the March’s ATH.  Source: CryptoQuant    Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Bloomberg Analyst: Bitcoin Could Face Challenges Ahead Amid Correlation with S&P 500
Date: October 23, 2024
Content:
[ccpw id="39382"] Date:  Written By:   Follow Us On The relationship between Bitcoin and traditional markets like the S&P 500 and commodities, including gold and copper, suggests challenges ahead.  Two recent charts from Bloomberg’s Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone discuss Bitcoin’s position in the market. The charts suggest that Bitcoin may face challenges going forward, especially in maintaining its status as a high-beta risk asset. The first chart shows the highest-ever 60-day correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 during a rising market. Notably, the correlation hit 0.5661, indicating that both assets are aligning strongly. This trend had stalled earlier in the year, per a previous report from The Crypto Basic. The renewed correlation suggests that Bitcoin, which some market watchers have viewed as a decentralized and independent asset, is now trading in lockstep with traditional equity markets.  This trend could signal a change in Bitcoin’s behavior. Investors have historically seen BTC as a hedge against traditional financial assets, but its growing correlation with the S&P 500 indicates that it is now behaving more like a high-beta risk asset.  https://x.com/thecryptobasic McGlone noted that this strong correlation may place a burden on Bitcoin’s beta to keep rising. Essentially, this means Bitcoin’s ability to outperform may depend on broader market performance, particularly in the context of economic growth and risk appetite. Additionally, McGlone drew a parallel between Bitcoin and copper, suggesting that both assets face similar issues in terms of their beta performance. Veteran trader Brandt has also confirmed Bitcoin’s bearish consolidation, but he remains optimistic. Meanwhile, copper has seen a trajectory that mirrors Bitcoin’s, indicating that both assets are sensitive to the shifts in economic growth expectations. This suggests Bitcoin may struggle to maintain its upward momentum if economic conditions weaken. The second chart points out Bitcoin’s underperformance relative to gold, despite the S&P 500 remaining relatively elevated. Brandt also previously discussed this position. Gold Outperforming Bitcoin and Elevated Risk Assets – #Bitcoin lagging #gold despite the record-setting S&P 500 may augur headwinds for risk assets. At 24 ounces of the metal equal to the crypto on Oct. 22, the Bitcoin/gold ratio is below a high of 34 in March and a 2021 peak of… pic.twitter.com/oqYxi2yZht — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) October 23, 2024  For context, the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio has fallen to 24 ounces of gold per Bitcoin, down from a high of 34 in March 2024 and a peak of 37 in 2021. This decline suggests that while Bitcoin has seen growth since 2021, it has not kept pace with gold’s recent strength. McGlone suggested that this lagging performance could signal headwinds for Bitcoin and other risk assets. Gold’s outperformance during periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility has long established it as a safe-haven asset.  The fact that Bitcoin, which most market commentators call “digital gold,” is struggling to keep up with physical gold raises questions about its long-term position as a store of value. The continued growth of the S&P 500, despite Bitcoin’s lag relative to gold, may also point to market risks. While equities have remained strong, Bitcoin’s decoupling from gold may show growing investor caution cryptocurrencies.  Discouragingly, this caution could become more pronounced if inflationary pressures, geopolitical risks, or other macroeconomic factors continue to weigh on global markets. At press time, BTC currently trades for $66,702, down 1.03% over the past 24 hours. DisClamier: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

Title: Arkham Intelligence says - 'Previous Tesla Bitcoin transfers were simply...' - AMBCrypto
Date: October 23, 2024
Content:
Arkham Intelligence uncovers the details behind Tesla transferring Bitcoin worth $760 million.  Last week, the news of Tesla transferring nearly its entire Bitcoin [BTC] holding, worth $760 million at the time, to unknown wallets made headlines in the crypto sphere.  These transfers fueled speculation of potential sell-offs. However, those concerns may not be warranted. Arkham Intelligence has now come out stating that the electric car manufacturer still likely retains ownership of its BTC.   The blockchain intelligence platform took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify, “We believe that the Tesla wallet movements that we reported on last week were wallet rotations with the Bitcoin still owned by Tesla.” According to Arkham Intelligence, Tesla’s BTC holdings had remained untouched for two years before the 15th of October.  The recent movement saw the king coin being split across seven different wallets, each holding between 1,100 and 2,200 BTC.  The platform also highlighted that each of these wallets received test transactions, and all but one held a rounded figure of Bitcoin. The two largest wallets, “1Fnhp” and “1LERL,” received 2,109.3 BTC and 1,900 BTC, respectively.  Other wallets included “1D6Vh” with 1,800 BTC, “16QZn” with 1,700 BTC, “1QC2z” holding 1,600 BTC, “1Phab” with 1,300 BTC, and “1MGM8” receiving 1,100 BTC. The reason for these transfers remains unclear, though Arkham noted speculation that Tesla might be moving the funds to a custodian. This could potentially be to secure a loan using the BTC as collateral. Interestingly, the transfers did not have an impact on Bitcoin’s price. On the day of the transfers, the coin peaked at nearly $68,000 and continued to trend upward until a recent dip on 21st October. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $67,082, reflecting a 0.68% decline over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin’s trading volume also dropped by 20.28% over the past day. Since Tesla’s recent transfers were made to wallets the company likely controls, thereby it still owned 11,509 Bitcoin. This was worth over $771 million at press time. Source: Arkham Intelligence It is worth noting that Tesla is set to release its next earnings report on the 23rd of October 2024.  This could shed more light on Tesla’s BTC strategy and the reasons behind the recent wallet movements. In addition to Tesla’s holdings, Musk’s other venture, SpaceX, retained 8,285 Bitcoin. These holdings, which have also not moved in two years, were valued at $556 million.     Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: 🚨Crypto Liquidations Top $190 Million As Bitcoin Slides Below $67,000: Can BTC Rebound❓ | Research Expert on Binance Square
Date: Date not available
Content:
In the past 24 hours, crypto liquidations worth $190 million were recorded as Bitcoin (BTC) failed to break through the crucial $70,000 resistance level. 🔸Bitcoin Remains Range-Bound, Just Shy Of New ATH According to data from CoinGlass, in the past 24 hours, more than 60,000 traders with positions worth over $190 million were liquidated as BTC fell from approximately $69,300 on October 21 to $66,940 at press time Interestingly, Ethereum (ETH) liquidations amounted to $46.2 million, nearly matching BTC’s liquidations of $47.7 million. Following them were Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Apecoin (APE), with liquidations of $9.2 million, $8.2 million, and $5.1 million, respectively. Notably, almost 83% of liquidations – worth $159 million – were long positions, while 17% – worth $31 million – were short positions. Binance accounted for nearly 44% of total liquidations, followed by OKX at 33% and HTX at 12.4%. The tilt toward long positions indicates that most traders expect BTC to breach its all-time high (ATH) of $73,737 soon. However, BTC must first decisively overcome the strong resistance at $70,000 to post a new ATH. Per Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital, a break above the $70,000 price level will likely attract retail attention. In a Telegram broadcast, the firm wrote: However with no major catalysts this week, we expect crypto to chop around these levels as it attempts to break higher. In terms of macro data, we only have PMI numbers on Thursday (24 Oct) where the market will look for some reassurance if the Fed will remain on their rate cut path. 🔸Crypto Analysts Foresee New Bitcoin ATH Soon Although BTC has yet to cross $70,000, several crypto analysts predict that the leading digital asset will soon record a new ATH. For instance, crypto analyst Crypto Caesar explained on X that, during the weekly timeframe, BTC trades within a multi-year ascending channel. According to the analyst, every corrective wave has found support at a higher low. They added: The price is currently completing the 4th corrective wave, holding near the strong support around $66,000. This zone aligns with previous resistance levels and is now acting as a potential launch point. The anticipated 5th wave could push BTC towards a potential new high, aiming for levels around $100,000 if it breaks the upper resistance near $72,000.   The analyst concluded that a decisive breakout above the current consolidation pattern and resistance could ignite a major BTC rally. Another crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, emphasized that the market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio has finally turned bullish.  For those unfamiliar, the MVRV ratio calculates BTC’s market cap divided by its realized cap – the value at which it was last traded. This ratio helps assess whether BTC is overvalued or undervalued relative to its recent trading activity. The chart below shows that sizable gains in BTC price have typically accompanied an upside movement in the MVRV ratio.   Despite the optimism, Google searches for Bitcoin-related keywords have recently plummeted, indicating lukewarm retail interest in the asset. BTC trades at $66,940 at press time, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours.  #UptoberBTC70K?

Title: Bitcoin, Shiba Inu, and Chainlink Dominate Santiment’s Hotlist as $230K BTC Target Looms - TokenPost

Bitcoin, Shiba Inu, and Chainlink emerge as top picks in Santiment’s crypto sentiment report. Credit: EconoTimes Thu, 24 Oct 2024, 03:23 am UTC Santiment’s latest analysis ranks Bitcoin, Shiba Inu, and Chainlink among the top cryptos with soaring market sentiment. As analysts predict Bitcoin could hit $230K, these coins are set to be major players in the next rally. Santiment Highlights 10 Cryptos with 'Crowd Optimism'  In fact, Santiment profiled ten digital currencies that it said had "crowd optimism." According to Coingape, the analytics platform coined this phrase to identify the cryptocurrencies that are generating the most buzz among the community. Chainlink is ranked first among those with a valuation of $500 million or more.  On multiple occasions recently, the oracle service provider has been in the news. Chainlink is revolutionizing interoperability with its Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which includes privacy protections.  Bitcoin and Dogecoin Dominate Community Discussions Santiment listed Filecoin, Shiba Inu, Bitcoin, Goat Network, Dogecoin, XRP, PEPE, and Beam, among other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, in particular, has been the subject of much discussion as of late. This week, Bitcoin was at the centre of a number of social debates, including those surrounding the possible prohibition of BTC by the Indian government and the self-custody scandal involving Michael Saylor.  So far this week, Dogecoin has also caught the eye of ordinary investors. With talk of ETFs and DOGE whale accumulations, the coin is likely to be the catalyst for a new bull rise. Speculation Could Drive Short-Term Gains Speculative market activity, according to Santiment, might cause the currencies' prices to spike in the near future, even though they are now trading at lower levels. Bitcoin Still the Benchmark for Cryptocurrencies Remember that Bitcoin is still the industry standard when it comes to measuring cryptocurrencies. Based on occurrences like as the spot Bitcoin ETF movement, some analysts are projecting that the All-Time High (ATH) could be surpassed by the year's conclusion. Analysts Predict Bold Bitcoin Price Peaks Specifically, Bernstein analysts projected that the coin's value would peak at $220,000. If Bitcoin follows Gold's bullish path, another audacious price prediction has it surging to $230,000. There are no assurances in the market, but public opinion and anticipation might soon propel the highlighted coins to new heights. TokenPost | [email protected] <Copyright © TokenPost.

Title: Here is Shiba Inu Price if SHIB ETF Approves and Gets 50% of BTC ETFs Flow
Date: October 24, 2024
Content:
[ccpw id="39382"] Date:  Written By:   Follow Us On Shiba Inu price could skyrocket to unimaginable levels if a SHIB ETF gains approval and commands 50% of the Bitcoin ETFs flows. Institutional investors entered the crypto scene following the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF products. After their eventual launch in January, these investment products attracted massive capital, pumping these funds into the Bitcoin market and catalyzing a positive price reaction. As a result, Bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high above $73K in March 2024, right before the latest halving event, marking the first time this phenomenon occurred in a halving year.  While flows into these investment products slowed amid the corrective phase of the market from mid-March. Now, with the latest market rebound, inflows have resumed in recent weeks. As a result, the Bitcoin ETF products have now witnessed a massive $21.4 billion in cumulative capital inflows since January. Amid the success of the Bitcoin ETFs, the crypto community turned to the possibility of subsequent ETF products tracking other crypto assets.  https://x.com/thecryptobasic Being the second-largest crypto asset, Ethereum (ETH) was naturally the choice for this. Notably, Ethereum ETFs secured regulatory approval in July, but have not enjoyed as much success as their Bitcoin counterparts. Despite this, market commentators are now looking out for the next cryptocurrency to secure ETF products. Asset managers have already filed to launch ETFs tracking Solana (SOL) and XRP, but these are yet to secure approval.  However, some have argued for a Shiba Inu ETF. The Shiba Inu project has expanded its ecosystem, looking to transcend its meme origin to become a contender in the utility token space. Amid these developments, individuals like content marketer Lucie believe a SHIB ETF is likely to launch. In addition, the Shiba Inu community launched a petition in June to ask Grayscale, the largest digital asset manager, to file for a Shiba Inu ETF with the SEC. While the petition has gained momentum, should Grayscale decide to file for the product, it would still require regulatory approval before launch. Meanwhile, the introduction of such a product would bring immense benefit to the Shiba Inu market, which requires an inflow of fresh capital. However, the extent of this benefit remains to be seen. As a result, we recently assessed how much Shiba Inu could rally if it records 50% of the total cumulative Bitcoin ETF inflows. For context, with spot Bitcoin ETFs now boasting $21.4 billion in net capital flows, 50% of this figure is $10.7 billion. An injection of this capital into SHIB would mark a turning point for the market. Leveraging only a quarter of the Bank of America (BoA) multiplier of 118x would bring in a multiplier of 29.5x. With this 29.5x multiplier, the $10.7 billion capital inflow could translate to an additional market cap figure of $315.65 billion. Shiba Inu currently boasts a market cap of $10.5 billion with a supply of 589 trillion tokens. An addition of $315.65 billion to this market cap would lead to a valuation of $326.15 billion. This market cap translates to a price of $0.0005537 per SHIB, considering the 589 trillion supply remains fairly the same. Shiba Inu must rally 3,000% from its current price to reach this price level. DisClamier: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

Date: Date not available
Content:
#ScrollOnBinance   ---$BTC   🚨 #BTCUSDT Analysis: Major Fake-Out at Resistance 🚨  The current Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) chart is presenting some interesting developments that require careful attention. As we have been tracking, BTC faced a fake-out near the 66,080 mark after making an attempt to break through the upper trendline. This region has acted as a key resistance level several times in the past, and history seems to be repeating itself.  🔍 What Happened?  Bitcoin has been trading within a clear channel, with the price testing the upper trendline (marked with red arrows on the chart). Historically, this trendline has proven difficult to break, and once again, BTC was rejected. What makes this situation more crucial is the fake-out we’re witnessing, where the price briefly surged past resistance, only to fall back into the previous range.  A fake-out is often a signal of incoming volatility, as it can trap many traders into thinking a breakout is happening, only to reverse the momentum. This can lead to increased sell pressure and a potential price drop.  📉 Key Levels to Watch:  Resistance: 66,080 (this has proven to be a significant barrier).  Major Resistance Zone: Between 69,687 and 73,777 – a break beyond this would signal bullish continuation.  Support Zone: BTC has strong support in the Demand Zone and Fair Value Gap (FVG) area around 52,017, as highlighted on the chart.   📊 What’s Next?  With the fake-out now in play, here’s what could happen:  1. Downside Scenario:  If BTC continues to be rejected from the 66k level and struggles to gain momentum, we could see a retracement back to the Demand Zone around 52,017.  This level has historically acted as strong support, and with the FVG nearby, it’s a key area for potential buyers to step in.  Target: Watch for BTC to test 52,017 if it continues to break down below key support levels.    2. Upside Potential:  However, should Bitcoin manage to reclaim the 66k level and hold it with conviction, we could see another push towards the Major Resistance Zone of 69,687 to 73,777.  A decisive break above this zone would open the door for BTC to challenge previous highs and potentially test the 80k psychological level.  Target: A successful breakout could lead to significant bullish momentum, but we need confirmation before acting on it.     🔥 Final Thoughts:  Right now, Bitcoin is at a critical juncture. The fake-out shows signs of weakness in the market, and with the high resistance around 66,080, caution is advised. If BTC can break through and hold higher levels, we might see a rally. Otherwise, a trip down to the 52k demand zone could be on the cards.  --- #APTSurpassesSUI  #XRPDonationsUSElections  #UptoberBTC70K?  #GameFiTokensRally

Home - News - Found the wrong guy? Peter Todd is hiding because of an HBO documentary that called him the creator of bitcoin 
Tetiana Nechet
 Автор статей 



 Peter Todd, a 39-year-old Canadian software developer who played a key role in the early creation of bitcoin, was furious when he was named Satoshi Nakamoto in the documentary Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery directed by Cullen Hoback. The Canadian cryptographer and computer scientist is forced to go into hiding due to fears for his life after the release of the film on HBO, in which he was allegedly exposed as the inventor of bitcoin (BTC), known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The developer said this in an interview with Wired. Todd also claims that the director of the movie, Cullen Hoback, used questionable evidence and then came to a false conclusion. Previously, Todd has repeatedly denied that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, and did it again on the eve of the movie’s release. As stated in the movie and confirmed by various sources, Todd often made joking statements: «Me — Satoshi». These words are compared to the famous phrase «I am Spartacus» from the 1960 movie of the same name, where captured soldiers claimed to be Spartacus one by one to protect the real hero. As Wired writes, Todd agreed to take part in the documentary because he believed that the film would focus on the history of Bitcoin rather than trying to expose its creator. Todd believes that he was wrongly labelled Satoshi, and now his life is being threatened: «Obviously, falsely accusing ordinary people of possessing vast amounts of wealth puts them at risk of being robbed or kidnapped. This is not only a stupid question, but also a dangerous one. Satoshi obviously did not want to be found, and no one should help those who try to do so. Cullen Hoback takes a different view. According to him, Todd and the others exaggerate the situation, and the attempt to find Satoshi did not pose any real threat to those who appeared in the movie. In addition, Hobak said Todd denies that he is Satoshi too much. «Peter Todd tells Wired that he has gone underground. He then mocks Wired for covering this narrative by appearing on stage today. As the author of the article aptly put it: «Todd’s trolling not only isolates him, but also exposes him». As a reminder, after the Wired interview was published, Todd wrote that the information about his hiding is «exaggerated».

Title: US Can Run Fiscal Deficits Permanently If Government Bans or Taxes Bitcoin, According to New Fed Paper - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
A government can run a “permanent primary deficit” if it bans or taxes Bitcoin (BTC), according to researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. The Fed researchers ask their readers to imagine an economy “in which the government issues stock and pays a flow of non-negative dividends.” “If a unit of government stock is used as the numeraire, then the price level in this economy is the price of consumption in units of government stock. And the nominal interest rate is the dividend yield on government stock. Agents in this economy who hold government stock are, in effect, holding a nominal bank account at the Treasury that pays a certain nominal interest rate.” The researchers note that they use Bitcoin as a metaphor for a private sector security that has a fixed supply and doesn’t offer a claim to any real resources. “Given a need to finance government purchases equal to a certain fraction of aggregate consumption, the policy that maximizes utility in our economy (and also its growth rate) is for the government to charge very large consumption taxes. This implies very large permanent primary surpluses and a unique equilibrium, and it turns government stock into a very large Lucas tree that eliminates almost all idiosyncratic risk. But large consumption taxes may not be feasible, and then a permanent primary deficit may be the best the government can do, provided the equilibrium does indeed deliver the targeted steady state. To achieve this, the government could simply make Bitcoin illegal.  Our final result says that, short of full prohibition, the government could use a continuous Markov policy and combine it with a tax on Bitcoin.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Bitcoin Whale Sells $9.68M in BTC Amid Market Drop
Date: Date not available
Content:
The Currency analytics 
Cryptocurrency News – REAL News ® – TCAT  Bitcoin whale—an investor who has been active since the inception of Bitcoin—has sold a substantial amount of BTC. This sale comes amid ongoing market volatility, raising concerns among investors about the implications for Bitcoin’s future.  As of this morning, Bitcoin’s price has dropped to approximately $67,000, erasing gains made in the previous three days. This decline has prompted many investors to rethink their exposure to Bitcoin, especially as it coincides with increased volatility in traditional financial markets. With looming macroeconomic risks, the cautious sentiment has led to a wave of sell-offs. According to Arkham Intelligence, the whale sold an impressive $9.68 million worth of Bitcoin recently. This investor has been part of the Bitcoin ecosystem since January 2009, having started mining just five days after the first block was created. Following this latest sale, the whale’s remaining Bitcoin holdings are valued at around $72.09 million. This isn’t the first time this particular whale has sold BTC; reports show that on October 14, the whale moved $5.47 million worth of Bitcoin over a two-month period, including a notable transfer of $630,000 BTC to Kraken. The consistent selling pattern has raised speculation about the whale’s motivations and how these actions might be influencing Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. The news of the whale’s sell-off has stirred a mix of reactions among investors. Many are concerned about the potential ripple effects that such large transactions can have on the market, especially during periods of uncertainty. When prominent investors start to reduce their holdings, it can signal a lack of confidence in the asset’s near-term performance. However, it’s important to note that while this whale is offloading Bitcoin, other large investors have been actively accumulating it. This contradictory behavior within the market underscores the complex dynamics at play. Despite the sell-off from the long-time whale, a trend of accumulation by other large-scale investors persists. Michaël van de Poppe, Chief Investment Officer and Founder of MN Consultancy, notes that the ongoing purchases by these investors suggest strong market confidence. They seem to be betting on future growth in the Bitcoin market, indicating a potentially optimistic outlook. This duality in the market—where some are selling while others are buying—creates a complex narrative. The accumulation trend hints at possible future price targets ranging from $300,000 to $500,000, according to van de Poppe. Such ambitious forecasts suggest that large investors are looking beyond short-term volatility and are focused on long-term growth. As Bitcoin experiences this turbulent period, the actions of both long-term whales and new large investors will play a crucial role in shaping market sentiment. While the recent sell-off by the ancient whale raises concerns, the ongoing accumulation by other investors offers a glimmer of hope. Investors must stay vigilant and informed as they navigate these uncertain waters. Understanding the motivations behind significant transactions and keeping an eye on broader market trends can provide valuable insights for making informed decisions in the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrency. In summary, the cryptocurrency market remains a dynamic and unpredictable environment. The recent sale by a 15-year-old Bitcoin whale has initiated discussion and concern, yet the concurrent activity from large investors suggests that there is still confidence in Bitcoin’s potential. As we move forward, the interplay between these different investor behaviors will be critical in determining the future direction of Bitcoin prices.

Title: That Bitcoin (BTC) Chart Bulls Don’t Want You to See…
Date: Oct. 23, 2024 8:39 pm UTC

Home » News » Bitcoin » That Bitcoin (BTC) Chart Bulls Don’t Want You to See NAIROBI (CoinChapter.com)—It seems even Bitcoin isn’t immune to gravity. The latest chart making rounds on social media is not for the faint of heart, particularly if you’ve been betting on Bitcoin’s bull run. It shows Bitcoin’s slide from its lofty perch at around $74,000 in August down to a less majestic spot below $60,000. Crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen highlighted this in a recent video, noting the cryptocurrency’s inability to breach the $70,000 resistance. Drawing parallels to the 2019 correction, Cowen pointed out the absence of fiscal stimuli such as rate cuts and quantitative easing, which supported past rallies. “If Bitcoin can’t break through and starts to fade, we could see more of those 2019 similarities,” Cowen explained to his 818,000 YouTube subscribers. Cowen also noted the potential need for economic interventions to spur a rally. “Perhaps another rate cut or more quantitative easing could propel Bitcoin to new heights,” he suggested, underscoring the impact of broader economic policies on crypto valuations. Contrasting with Cowen’s cautious stance, another prominent crypto analyst, TechDev, offers an optimistic forecast for BTC. On X, TechDev drew comparisons between Bitcoin’s price movements and the historic rally of Japan’s Nikkei index which began in 1975. He told his 473,000 followers, “This next phase could be more challenging to predict than you might expect.” TechDev emphasized the unpredictability of market shifts that could rapidly elevate Bitcoin’s value. “When the broader market catches on, expect swift gains. Historically, just 30 days have driven 99% of Bitcoin’s growth over the past decade,” he pointed out. As Bitcoin struggled to regain its bullish momentum, institutional investors seized the opportunity to accumulate. Oct. 21 saw U.S. spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) register $297.60 million in inflows. These were led by BlackRock’s IBIT fund, which contributed $332.30 million. However, despite these inflows, Bitcoin’s price failed to hold the $70,000 level, facing a sharp rejection that sent it tumbling to the lower $67,000 range. Diverging from institutional behavior, large-scale individual investors, or “whales,” have also made notable moves. Whale Alert recently tracked a significant transaction where 1,446 BTC were transferred to Binance, amounting to roughly $96 million. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s recent market behavior presents a complex narrative of caution and optimism. While challenges such as resistance at the $70,000 level evoke memories of 2019’s downturn.

Title: Analysts Cautious Outlook on Potential Pre-Election Consolidation: Will Bitcoin Face Resistance? - Herald Sheets
Date: Date not available
Content:
Table of Contents Crypto analysts give a cautious outlook, citing potential consolidation with Bitcoin and Ethereum set to encounter critical resistance levels.  The US market research firm grants Bitcoin and Ethereum a neutral rating, indicating they edge closer to critical resistance levels. Nonetheless, the experts admit that BTC and ETH could still attract substantial attention when they blast through.  The Bitcoin price has retreated 1.3% to $66,189.42 while Ethereum tumbled 2% to $2,567.87 in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data. Market analysts downplay the short-term dip with an optimistic call for a potential breakout.  Crypto exchange StealthEX Maria Carola attributes the BTC price movement to geopolitical factors. The chief of Cayman Islands-based crypto platforms considers that Donald Trump is establishing a stronger position as the election date edges closer.   Carola observed a strengthening candidacy of a GOP candidate two weeks to the election date will positively impact the BTC price. Polling platform FiveThirtyEight illustrates that Trump’s candidacy has gained by 0.5% since the onset of October. Nonetheless, Kamala Harris still leads with 48.2%, slightly ahead of Trump’s 46.4%. Despite the current slip in Bitcoin price, Carola forecasts BTC will surpass the psychological threshold of $70K by the end of October. Nevertheless, the StealthEx executive is cautious about Bitcoin setting a new peak immediately.   Carola considers that other global factors will influence the Bitcoin price movement. Notably, she pointed out that the Middle East conflict and stablecoins regulations are potential triggers towards unexpected shifts in the market.  In its Tuesday note, QCP Capital considers Bitcoin and Ethereum prices hovering near the critical resistance levels. The trading firm analysts illustrate that the assets are below their July highs, though acknowledged BTC is within the $70K and $2.8K for ETH.  The Singapore-based crypto firm revealed that it would attract substantial retail attention if the two assets cleared their levels. Nonetheless, they ruled out the existence of major catalysts this week. Consequently, the analysts expect the BTC and ETH will hover within the narrow range though stage attempts to break higher. The QCP analysts hold the election and deliver a zero-sum scenario for the equities and sector winners reliant on the outcome. The analysts added that the candidates contesting for the US presidents appear more crypto-friendly, unlike in the past administration. Consequently, the firm indicates that weakness in equities could prompt the relocation of the capital to crypto assets.   Fairlead Strategies provided a cautious outlook, classifying BTC and Ethereum as neutral rated across the short to long term. The US-based research firm considers Bitcoin to be within a critical juncture and is testing the trendline resistance of $67,000.  The analysts observed that the BTC hit the counter-trend sell signal during the weekend. The trigger could translate to several weeks of consolidation within the current price levels.   The Fairlead analysts consider the BTC is within the proving ground as the largest crypto by market value tests the trendline near $67,700. They retained the support levels near $59.8K while the resistance remains at $67.7 and $73.8K.  The Fairlead analysts’ outlook aligns with the position of Zerocap chief investment executive Jonathan Wet. The expert indicated that Bitcoin’s rise beyond $70K is on course with no visible signs of slowing down.  Wet opines that several tailwinds are converging towards stimulating the bullish steam needed for BTC to print a new all-time high. Notably, the investment executive considers the political developments witnessed in the US to be fueling optimism that the crypto industry will witness favorable policy.  Fairlead notes that Ethereum portrays signs of upside exhaustion. The analysts consider ETH to be facing resistance of nearly $2,807, though it is retaining support of around $2,486. The inability of ETH to blast beyond the resistance levels could usher in a short-term corrective phase. However, BTC and ETH would likely struggle within the consolidation phase unless they decisively overcome the resistance hurdles.  Michael Scott is a skilled and seasoned news writer with a talent for crafting compelling stories.

Title: Bitcoin's Future: Will It Soar to $100,000 or Face a Major Correction
Date: Date not available
Content:
The Currency analytics 
Cryptocurrency News – REAL News ® – TCAT  Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has captured the attention of investors and traders alike with recent forecasts suggesting a potential rise to $100,000. After months of price stagnation since March 2024, many are eager to understand what this means for the future of Bitcoin. Renowned crypto analyst DonAlt recently shared his insights, shedding light on the possibilities and risks involved.  As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $67,554, experiencing a slight drop of over 2% in the past day. This decline comes amid a backdrop of volatility that has characterized the cryptocurrency market for much of 2024. Despite this dip, many are optimistic about Bitcoin’s prospects, particularly with the expectation of a breakout from its current price range. In a recent YouTube update to his 62,400 followers, DonAlt provided an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. He noted that Bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase, meaning its price has been relatively stable without significant upward or downward movement. DonAlt believes this phase is about to end, and a breakout is imminent. “My base case is that we’re going to break out, and then it’s going to get smacked down,” he stated, implying that after an initial surge, Bitcoin may rise to between $80,000 and $100,000. However, he cautioned that this could be followed by a significant correction, bringing the price back down to around $60,000. DonAlt’s prediction highlights a common pattern in cryptocurrency trading known as “breakout and correction.” This scenario occurs when an asset experiences a sharp increase in price, often fueled by market excitement or positive news, only to see a subsequent decline as profit-taking begins or market sentiment shifts. “After reaching that peak, I expect we’ll see Bitcoin drop back to about $60,000,” DonAlt explained. This drop would serve as a new support level, where the price stabilizes before potentially rising again. While DonAlt is optimistic about the breakout, he remains cautious about the sustainability of this upward trend. “There’s a good chance that the breakout doesn’t really stick now,” he warned. According to him, Bitcoin may stabilize around $60,000 for some time before making another attempt at higher prices. Market sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency price movements. Positive news can drive prices up, while negative news or market uncertainty can lead to rapid declines. As such, traders and investors must keep an eye on broader market trends, news developments, and social media discussions surrounding Bitcoin. One of the standout points in DonAlt’s analysis is the need for flexibility in trading strategies. He emphasized that while he currently holds a bullish stance on Bitcoin, he is open to changing his view based on market developments. “If I’m bullish now and we go to $90,000 and then I just see bullishness everywhere, I can change my mind,” he said. This adaptability is essential in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where conditions can change rapidly. Traders are encouraged to stay informed, adjust their strategies, and not get overly attached to any single prediction. While the prospect of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 is enticing, investors should approach with caution. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods. It’s essential for anyone considering investing in Bitcoin to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved. Setting realistic expectations and developing a solid risk management strategy are vital for navigating this unpredictable market. Investors should only invest what they can afford to lose and consider diversifying their portfolios to mitigate risks. As Bitcoin hovers around $67,000, traders and investors are eagerly anticipating whether DonAlt’s predictions will materialize. Will Bitcoin break through the $100,000 barrier, or will the anticipated correction hinder its progress? The next few weeks will be critical for the cryptocurrency as it navigates this uncertain terrain. With significant potential rewards come substantial risks. Staying informed and adaptable will be key for those involved in Bitcoin trading. As the market evolves, all eyes will be on Bitcoin to see how it reacts to the predictions and market dynamics ahead.

Title: Meet ZachXBT, the Masked Vigilante Tracking Down Billions in Crypto Scams and Thefts | WIRED
Date: Oct 24, 2024 5:00 AM
Content:
To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. On August 19, a twentysomething man who goes by the online handle ZachXBT was walking into an airport to board a flight home—which airport, his real name, where home is, he’d rather not say—when he saw an alert on his phone. A sum of bitcoins had just been transferred to a small cryptocurrency exchange, one of many whose transactions he constantly monitors on Bitcoin’s blockchain for signs of criminal money laundering. The alert piqued his interest: This transaction was worth around $600,000, a cash-out of funds that was easily 10 times bigger than the typical trade on that service. When he reached his gate, another ping alerted him to a second transaction on the same exchange worth more than $1 million. Then one for $2 million. As he stood in line to board his plane, ZachXBT hurriedly traced the money on his phone, following it backward in time from one Bitcoin address to another, flagging the suspicious funds and racing to find their origin before the half hour of internet blackout between wheels-up and the plane's Wi-Fi coming online. Before he was in the air, he had determined that the money had come from a crypto wallet that had held hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin that hadn't moved since 2012—and that this nine-figure mountain of money was now being hurriedly liquidated at exchanges with high transaction costs that no patient, decade-plus Bitcoin investor would accept. To ZachXBT, the flow of funds immediately looked instead like a giant theft. In fact, as he double-checked his findings, it appeared that someone had stolen around $243 million worth of Bitcoin from one unlucky victim, perhaps the biggest known crypto heist ever to target an individual. “It was such an abnormally large amount stolen from a single person,” ZachXBT tells WIRED. “I had to make sure I wasn't crazy.” Once he was above 10,000 feet with working Wi-Fi, ZachXBT began to trace more outflows of the stolen funds as they were passed through one exchange and coin-swapping service after another. Over the next hours, he raced to graph out the branching money movements as the thieves transferred the coins through more than a dozen of those platforms in an apparent attempt at obfuscating their path. As he followed that trail back to whoever had lost the bitcoins, ZachXBT could see that a portion of the funds had originally come from the now-defunct Genesis cryptocurrency exchange. He direct-messaged the exchange's administrators on X and asked them to put him in touch with the victim, who would ultimately hire him to hunt for the stolen money. By the time his flight had landed, ZachXBT had come to see that there were three main threads of the stolen funds—going to what he believed were three likely culprits. He had also posted a message to his more than 650,000 followers on X, pointing out the theft in progress on the blockchain. He would soon be rewarded with a message from a source who claimed to have clues of the thieves' identities. Over the next week, working on the case day and night, sleeping no more than four or five hours at a time, and periodically sharing his findings with law enforcement agencies, ZachXBT would identify the alleged suspects behind the theft—two young hackers named Malone Lam and Jeandiel Serrano, both in their early twenties. (ZachXBT also identified another alleged hacker whom WIRED has chosen not to publicly name because the individual hasn't been arrested or charged.) He even obtained a video recording that he says shows one of their screens as the theft was completed and they celebrated their enormous windfall. In his whirlwind investigation, ZachXBT went so far as to track the alleged suspects on Instagram and TikTok, watching one of them blow millions on cars, private jets, and clubs where the alleged culprit spent as much as $500,000 a night. Less than a month after the alert pinged ZachXBT's phone on the plane, two out of three suspected thieves would be arrested and criminally charged. When ZachXBT finally saw the mug shot of one of the alleged hackers, he says he felt a brief rush of adrenaline. But it passed quickly. “I didn't really feel any special sense of accomplishment,” ZachXBT says. “I was just treating it as any other case.” If tracing a quarter-billion-dollar theft feels to ZachXBT like just another day on the internet, that's perhaps because he has distinguished himself over the past three years as the most prolific independent crypto-focused detective in the world. Since he began his work as an amateur investigator in 2021, he has traced billions of dollars in stolen funds and scams. By his own count—which he broke down for WIRED in a spreadsheet—his hundreds of investigations have directly led to the recovery of around $210 million worth of criminal crypto proceeds, as well as another $225 million in seized funds he had at least some less-direct hand in helping to claw back for victims. He has called out influencers promoting coins in pump-and-dump schemes, hunted down cybercriminals behind massive crypto heists, and revealed dozens of incidents of North Korean hackers breaching crypto firms or even infiltrating those companies as employees. Throughout all of it, he has been funded almost entirely by cryptocurrency donations in the forms of grants from cryptocurrency organizations and payments from strangers who send contributions to an address he lists in his social media profiles, adding up to around $1.3 million since 2021. “He's a new generation of investigator. He works for the people,” says Joe McGill, an analyst at the Secret Service who has collaborated with ZachXBT. “His success is completely tied to the success of his investigations.” As ZachXBT has pursued that career as a crypto vigilante, he has also kept his mask firmly in place. Online, he appears only as his avatar, a kind of platypus cartoon figure in a detective's trench coat or sometimes a hoodie. To avoid retaliation from his many enemies in the world of crypto criminals and con artists, he has never publicly shown his face nor revealed his real name or exact age and would only speak to WIRED on the condition that I not try to dig up those identifying details. On some of their early conference calls, McGill says, ZachXBT would not only keep his camera off but even use a voice-changer application, sometimes sounding like a high-pitched “South Park character,” as McGill puts it, or on other occasions deepening his voice's pitch until it reminded him of something out of a horror film. “It was very odd, initially,” says McGill, who at the time worked at the crypto-tracing firm TRM Labs. “But I respected his privacy, because this anonymous guy was doing really great work.” ZachXBT exposes so many crypto criminal scams and thefts on a near-weekly basis, often working far faster than law enforcement agencies, says Nick Bax, a cryptocurrency investigator and founder of the firm Five I's, that Bax has wondered half-jokingly if he might be some kind of bot. “He is a machine,” Bax says. As part of one investigation last year where they collaborated to trace a $60 million theft from a crypto project called AnubisDAO in 2021, Bax gave ZachXBT a list of 500 transactions on a Saturday night, each of which needed to be manually analyzed along with all its connected blockchain addresses. “I figured that would keep him busy for at least a few days,” Bax says. Instead, by early the next afternoon, ZachXBT had gone through every transaction and identified which ones were tied to the theft. “I was shocked,” Bax says. “He definitely had to have been on his computer for 12 hours straight.” Many of the results of ZachXBT's investigations are unceremoniously posted to his account on X. Over time, however, his findings have increasingly gained attention from law enforcement agencies—several of which he now often shares his findings with prior to publication. The result has been real and growing consequences for the targets of that detective work. “As Zach has gotten bigger, there have been financial repercussions and legal repercussions,” says Taylor Monahan, a security researcher at crypto firm MetaMask and one of ZachXBT's closest collaborators on investigations, including the $243 million theft case. “If Zach posts a thread about someone now, and it's a good one, that person is going to get arrested.” So how has ZachXBT managed to outrace and out-trace even law enforcement's crypto investigators, despite having no formal training or organizational support? Even he isn't entirely sure. “That's a tough question. I don't know why I'm good,” ZachXBT tells WIRED in a phone interview. He chalks it up to a willingness to work around the clock—crypto markets never close, after all—and a familiarity with analyzing cryptocurrency blockchains that comes from years of poring over those vast ledgers of transactions. “The more you look at the blockchain, like when you eat, sleep, and breathe it, it starts to make more sense over time,” he says. “You can just start to pick up on those connections. I can look at a wallet, and I can profile it and tell you if it's a bad actor within seconds.” ZachXBT says that familiarity with blockchains comes from his years of experience as a crypto enthusiast and trader—and as a victim himself of some of the crypto economy's many traps for unwary investors. Around 2017, he says, he was naively buying thousands of dollars worth of crypto tokens that would all eventually tank in value—often due to so-called “rug pulls,” when a crypto token's creator sells off their holdings and all the other investors are left with a worthless asset. “I was buying in like, ‘This is going to change the world.' I just held it and never sold,” ZachXBT says. As a result, he says, “I was the person getting scammed.” By 2018, not only had all those investments cratered, but an Electrum crypto wallet that ZachXBT used was hacked with a malicious software update. He lost close to $15,000 more. Only at that point did he decide to take a step back and rethink his approach. Instead of simply buying and holding tokens, he began analyzing cryptocurrencies' blockchains—almost all of which are publicly visible to anyone who can decipher the owner of different addresses—to see how larger, more successful investors were trading tokens and coins, then to try to emulate their moves. As a result of that blockchain analysis, he was familiar enough by 2020 with tracing crypto transactions to be able to spot scams in progress that weren't visible to the average investor. He'd see an influencer publicly promoting a crypto asset to their hundreds of thousands of followers, boosting its price, and then follow their funds on a blockchain to see that they were actually selling their own holdings immediately afterward in what often seemed to be a classic pump-and-dump scheme. “It was more like being a whistleblower,” ZachXBT says. “I'd notice that activity and think, ‘This kind of reminds me of what I fell for back in 2017 and 2018. Why not make a post about it?’ And that started to blow up.” When the NFT craze kicked off later that year, ZachXBT began similarly scrutinizing NFT projects like Bored Bunny and Billionaire Dogs Club to show where the money flowing into them was really going. Some of those NFT sellers would raise millions with little more than cartoon .jpg images, promising that the NFTs created from them would confer perks like entry to exclusive events or clubs. Instead, ZachXBT could see through blockchain analysis that the sellers were simply dividing and pocketing the funds. Sometimes, he'd even discover through crypto tracing that an NFT seller was, in fact, a rebrand of an earlier project that had already proven to be a scam. In some of those instances, ZachXBT's posts about NFT sellers did manage to scare off buyers and prevent shady NFT dealers from selling their wares. But over time, he grew bored of uncovering the same often transparent hustles run again and again, and frustrated with the lack of more concrete results: No one linked to the NFT projects he exposed faced criminal charges. Then, in early 2022, he began to notice that a group of hackers were taking over the Twitter accounts of high-profile crypto users and posting phishing links to Ethereum smart contracts designed to drain users' wallets, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in thefts. Whenever a devastated victim posted that their savings had been stolen, ZachXBT would make contact with them and then meticulously trace out the funds they'd lost. He combined those blockchain clues with sources he'd begun to develop in the Discord and Telegram channels frequented by young crypto thieves, which led him to a few online handles of teenagers who seemed to be behind the phishing campaign and were bragging about their massive scores. By this point, ZachXBT had become notorious enough in the crypto underworld that one person he believed to be a suspect had even included an apparent taunt about “mr xbt” in a Twitter post boasting about a diamond-encrusted Audemars Piguet wristwatch he'd bought. ZachXBT tracked down the watch seller in a luxury watch Discord channel and convinced the vendor, who had sold the timepiece for close to $50,000, to turn over the teenager's shipping address and real name. No public records appear to document whether the alleged thieves' were arrested—possibly because the suspects were minors and the charges have either been sealed or were never filed. But ZachXBT found a forfeiture notice showing that in October of 2022, a month after ZachXBT posted his findings on X, the FBI seized more than $200,000 worth of crypto assets from the teen suspect he’d identified—and the diamond watch. That same year, ZachXBT used similar techniques to trace another $2.5 million worth of NFTs stolen through a different phishing campaign to an alleged pair of French hackers. In that case, French prosecutors arrested five suspects a couple of months later and, according to Agence France-Presse, specifically credited ZachXBT's thread posted to X for aiding in their investigation into the two alleged ringleaders. “To see law enforcement acting on something I'd shared, that was very fulfilling,” ZachXBT says. “It made me think maybe I was actually onto something with what I'd been doing.” In the two years since first gaining law enforcement's attention, the scale—and, in some cases, the consequences—of ZachXBT's investigations has exploded. In February of 2023, he tracked down nearly $9 million in funds stolen from the crypto project Platypus, identifying one of the alleged thieves in a matter of hours; French police arrested two suspects just over a week later. Though the charges against the pair would ultimately be dropped, police recovered several million dollars in funds, and Platypus thanked ZachXBT in a tweet. Later that year, he traced a $25 million theft from crypto firm Uranium Finance, much of which appeared to have been laundered through the purchase of rare Magic: The Gathering cards. When the cybercriminal group known as Scattered Spider carried out a ransomware attack against Caesar's Entertainment in Las Vegas that extorted $15 million from the company, ZachXBT helped to trace and recover $12 million of the funds, according to other investigators who worked on the case and spoke with WIRED. Around the same time, ZachXBT published the results of a massive collection of investigations into 25 crypto thefts carried out by North Korea hackers totaling more than $200 million, about $7 million of which he'd helped to freeze. Around half of the hacks had never before been publicly revealed. He followed up that investigation with another that exposed a web of around 30 North Korean IT workers who had infiltrated tech companies and were being paid in cryptocurrency. In one case, one of those tech workers who seemed to be linked to North Korea had gotten hired at the NFT firm Munchables and had managed to steal $62 million in crypto assets from the company. When ZachXBT helped to identify and flag the funds, the spotlight on the thief made the money so hard to liquidate that they simply gave it back. Even so, when ZachXBT got the text alerts in the airport that put him onto the trail of $243 million taken from a single victim on August 19, it was one of the biggest thefts he'd ever chased. When he got back home from his international flight, he continued to follow those branching funds for days while monitoring social media for signs of his three suspects, two of whom went by the handles Greavys and Box. Greavys in particular—whose real name was Malone Lam and who appeared to be in Miami—was posting and appearing in photos of luxury real estate, diamond watches, jets, and sports cars including a Lamborghini Revuelto and a Pagani Huayra, the latter of which typically sells for more than $3 million. ZachXBT found posts from influencers to whom Greavys had gifted Birkin and Hermès purses worth between $30,000 and $50,000 each, and pictures of electric signs in a nightclub carried by servers that read, “WHO WANT A BIRK,” tagged with his name. “It seemed like all they did was just party and steal money,” ZachXBT says. Within a few days, he'd persuaded the source who'd first DMed him during his flight to send him a video of a screenshare among the three hackers who appeared to be involved in the theft. Unbeknownst to them, one of the alleged hackers had re-shared his screen during that screenshare with another group of friends—and one of them appears to have recorded it. Several times in the 90-minute video, ZachXBT says, the three hackers refer to each other by their first names. At another point, one of the three men also briefly flashed his Windows home screen, revealing his last name, too. The video even captures the moment of the alleged hackers’ delirious reaction to pulling off a nine-figure theft. “Oh my god! Oh my god! 243 million dollars! Yes!” one of them says in the recording. “I’m going to spaz out! Yo! We’re done. We’re done. I'm spazzing out. Do you know how much money that is?” Late in the afternoon on September 18, just shy of a month after ZachXBT's investigation began, Lam was arrested in Miami at a waterfront rental property for which he was paying $68,000 a month. Box—whose real name is Jeandiel Serrano—was taken into custody in the Los Angeles airport while flying home from a vacation in the Maldives with his girlfriend. According to prosecutors, he was wearing a $500,000 watch at the time of his arrest, was renting a house near LA for more than $40,000 a month, and had spent $1 million on luxury cars. The next day, wire fraud and money laundering charges against both Lam and Serrano were unsealed. According to court documents, both hackers had confessed to law enforcement investigators that they participated in multiple crypto thefts. Lam specifically admitted that the profits from them had funded his purchases of no fewer than 31 high-end cars. So far, $79 million of the $243 million they allegedly stole has been seized or frozen. ZachXBT is hopeful that more of the money will still be found. Prosecutors say that more than $100 million remains unaccounted for, even after the alleged hackers’ spending spree. ZachXBT’s third suspect, who appears to live in Connecticut, based on public records, has yet to be charged with any crime. Reporter Brian Krebs has pointed to a criminal complaint, however, that describes how a group of men allegedly carjacked a Connecticut couple in their fifties in a Lamborghini four days after the $243 million theft in late August and briefly kidnapped them because the carjackers “believed the victims’ son had access to significant amounts of digital currency”—suggesting that the victims may have been the parents of the third alleged recipient of the funds ZachXBT had traced. For ZachXBT, the investigation may be a kind of turning point. For the first time, he was retained by the victim in the case and was paid for his skills rather than working as a volunteer for donations. He says he may transition to doing more of that paid work or even start his own investigations firm. But he maintains that he's still not out to get rich from his exposés. “I see money seized, money returned to victims, people arrested, and that's my goal. That's what I set out to do,” ZachXBT says. “To see that it's benefiting people. That's what I get my gratification from.” His collaborator, Taylor Monahan of crypto wallet firm MetaMask, who has now worked with him on dozens of investigations, says she believes ZachXBT is still driven largely by a sense of justice—the kind that comes from once having been a victim of the crypto world's cruelty himself, and wanting to prevent that same outcome for others. “He had the same experience that so many people in this space have had, which is that something bad happens, and everyone around you says, ‘Sucks for you,’” Monahan says. “He viscerally rejects that experience. And he wants to change it.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day Interview: Bobbi Althoff on exactly how she got rich—and how rich A JD Vance adviser posted extensively on Reddit for years about drug use The doctor behind the “suicide pod” wants AI to assist at the end of life Event: Join us for WIRED Health on March 18 in London More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

Title: Denmark's 'historic' crypto tax change is far from a done deal
Date: 
12:09 PM • Oct 24, 2024 
Content:
Denmark is considering new tax rules on cryptocurrency, including taxing unrealized gains and losses, which has led to some misreporting that the decision has already been made. Crypto news outlet AltcoinBuzz falsely reported that Denmark “has made history by becoming the first country in the world to tax unrealized capital gains on cryptocurrency.” Meanwhile, CoinGape wrote that Denmark “will impose a 42% tax on unrealized capital gains for all crypto assets.” In reality, Denmark’s tax law council has proposed three separate models of taxation in a paper it has been working on since 2021. None of these tax proposals have been adopted in any official capacity. Even if one were agreed upon at press time, these rules most likely wouldn’t take effect until 2026. Tax Minister Rasmus Stoklund announced on Wednesday that the Tax Law Council had submitted up-to-date recommendations to “ensure more reasonable taxation of crypto investors’ gains and losses.” The 93-page report recommends that all cryptocurrency assets should be taxed the same, in order to remove the heavy taxations that some crypto holders must pay. Though three separate taxation models are proposed in the report, the Tax Law Council appears to recommend an inventory taxation model. Here, all assets — including stocks and bonds — would be lumped together and valued. The total change in value is taxed. Read more: Michael Saylor says he’s paying bitcoin taxes, unlike ‘crypto-anarchists’ “The Tax Law Council’s recommendations imply that the asymmetry in the taxation of gains and losses disappears,” the Skatteministeriet wrote in its press release. “That is, investors can deduct losses in gains on other crypto assets.  “In addition, the recommendations make it possible to set off gains on crypto assets against losses on financial contracts – and vice versa. The so-called inventory taxation occurs as capital income and in return implies that the taxation occurs continuously, regardless of whether crypto-assets have been sold,” (translated from Danish). The Danish parliament will be presented a bill somewhere in early 2025, and it must then carefully evaluate the report before any decision is made. The crypto tax report comes hot on the heels of a scheduled 50% hike in Italy, where capital gains tax on cryptocurrency is set to rocket from 26% to 42%. Got a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

Title: Bitcoin price drops to $65,000 as crypto is hammered with stock market
Date: PublishedYesterday
Content:
The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a downturn, closely mirroring the decline in the stock market. On Wednesday, Bitcoin saw a significant drop of over 2.5% in the past 24 hours, with its price hovering around $65,000. This decline has dashed hopes of breaking the $70,000 threshold, which had gained traction just a week prior. The downward trajectory underscores the growing volatility in the crypto market and highlights the interconnectedness between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets. The decline in Bitcoin can be attributed to mounting pressure on technology stocks, particularly Tesla (TSLA), which is set to release its latest earnings after the closing bell. Analysts anticipate that Tesla will report earnings per share of 60 cents, a decrease from 66 cents a year ago, although the figure marks an improvement from 52 cents in the previous quarter, according to estimates from FactSet (FDS). Revenue is projected to hit $25.4 billion, compared to $23.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and $25.5 billion in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note has continued its upward climb, reaching 4.23%—a level not seen since July. Higher bond yields traditionally create downward pressure on equity valuations. When Treasury yields rise, it suggests that investors are increasingly concerned about the economic outlook, leading them to favor safer investments like bonds over stocks. Other significant cryptocurrencies have also faced losses. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a decline of over 3% in the last 24 hours, currently trading around $2,500. Cardano fell by more than 3.5%, Avalanche dropped by over 4.5%, and the popular memecoin Shiba Inu decreased by approximately 3%.  Overall, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has contracted by 2%, now standing at $2.2 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Denmark proposes taxing unrealized crypto gains as it does with some traditional financial contracts
Date: Date not available
Content:
Denmark plans new crypto tax model to align with stock savings accounts, aiming for consistency across financial instruments. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Denmark is proposing a new taxation model that would tax unrealized gains on cryptocurrencies at 42%, aligning digital assets with existing rules for certain financial contracts. This approach involves calculating gains and losses annually based on the change in the value of the taxpayer’s holdings, regardless of whether the assets have been sold. The taxable income would reflect the difference between the value at the start and end of the year. Under this inventory-based taxation system, gains would be included as capital income, while losses could be deducted from gains in the same category within the same year. Unused losses could be carried forward to offset future gains. This method aims to provide a consistent framework for taxing financial instruments, including cryptocurrencies. Denmark handles some traditional financial contracts under the rules established in the Kursgevinstloven (Capital Gains Tax Act), specifically in Sections 29–33. However, only certain types of investments and accounts are subject to taxation on unrealized gains. Some equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Denmark are taxed on unrealized gains annually. These are typically ETFs that accumulate and reinvest dividends and are taxed at rates of 27% or 42% on unrealized gains each year. Aktiesparekonto (Stock Savings Account) allows individuals to invest in listed shares and share-based mutual funds with a 17% tax rate on returns. The taxation is based on the unrealized gains at the end of the year, following the ‘lagerprincippet’ (inventory principle). These investments are exceptions to the general rule, where traditional financial contracts like stocks and bonds are usually taxed on realized gains. The ‘lagerprincippet’ is applied to these specific investment types to encourage long-term investment strategies by taxing annual value increases rather than waiting until the investment is sold. The new system may be considered less burdensome for low-frequency traders, as they would have fewer assets to value annually, reducing administrative workload. Frequent traders might benefit from improved accuracy in reported income without the need to track individual transactions meticulously. Instead, they would focus on the overall change in their holdings’ value over the tax year. However, taxing unrealized gains raises liquidity concerns. Taxpayers might owe taxes on gains without selling assets to generate cash for payment. Recognizing this challenge, the recommendation includes possible measures to ease liquidity constraints, such as carryback rules or provisions to mitigate the effects of sudden price drops after the tax year ends. These measures aim to alleviate financial strain from taxing gains that exist only on paper. Implementing an inventory-based taxation model could significantly impact crypto investors in Denmark. Taxing unrealized gains may affect investment strategies, as investors might need to account for potential tax liabilities even when holding assets long-term. This could influence trading behavior, leading investors to realize gains or losses strategically to manage tax obligations. The requirement to pay taxes on paper gains might also impact the attractiveness of crypto investments compared to other asset classes. Liquidity issues are particularly notable in the crypto market, where asset values can fluctuate dramatically over short periods. Taxing gains that exist only on paper might strain investors’ resources, especially if the market experiences a downturn shortly after tax assessment. Even with measures to alleviate liquidity problems, investors could face challenges meeting tax obligations without liquidating assets, introducing additional risks and uncertainties. This move by Denmark aligns with increasing global regulatory scrutiny of crypto. As reported by CryptoSlate, researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and economists at the European Central Bank (ECB) have recently discussed ways to address the challenges of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Some have even suggested measures to “eliminate” Bitcoin, highlighting growing concerns among regulators about the impact of digital assets on traditional financial systems. ECB economist Jürgen Schaaf raised concerns that the rising price of Bitcoin disproportionately benefits early adopters, potentially leading to significant economic disadvantages for latecomers or non-holders. He argued that Bitcoin does not increase the economy’s productive capacity and that wealth gains for early investors come at the expense of others. Schaaf suggested that policies should be implemented to curb Bitcoin’s expansion or potentially eliminate it, warning that pro-Bitcoin policies could further skew wealth distribution and threaten societal stability. However, the Satoshi Action Fund has drafted a solid rebuttal to the ECB paper, succinctly highlighting the flaws in the arguments. Some observers view Denmark’s proposed taxation model as part of this broader effort, potentially aiming to reduce crypto usage by imposing stricter tax obligations. By aligning crypto taxation with certain financial contracts and taxing unrealized gains, the government could seek tighter crypto market regulation, possibly discouraging speculative investment. The proposed model aligns with Denmark’s existing taxation of financial contracts, promoting consistency across different financial instruments. By treating crypto similarly, authorities aim to streamline the tax system and reduce complexities in crypto taxation. This reflects an effort to integrate cryptocurrencies into the established financial regulatory framework. However, implementing such a taxation system requires careful consideration of its impact on investors and the broader crypto ecosystem. Balancing the need for effective taxation with the potential burden on taxpayers is crucial to avoid unintended consequences. These could include driving crypto activities underground, pushing investors to jurisdictions with more favorable tax regimes, or reducing the competitiveness of Denmark’s financial sector. The government’s recommendation signals a significant development in crypto taxation, emphasizing the desire to adapt tax laws to accommodate emerging financial technologies. How this proposal will affect Denmark’s crypto market remains to be seen, but it highlights the ongoing evolution of regulatory approaches to digital assets.

Title: Why Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson became crypto’s patron of the weird and wild  – DL News
Date: Date not available
Content:
About us Copy link  Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Cardano blockchain, likes to talk crypto. The 36-year-old billionaire also likes to chat about aliens. He financed an expedition to Papua New Guinea in 2023 to see if an interstellar object was potentially made by extraterrestrials. (It wasn’t.) And he likes to wax on about bison. He owns an 11,000-acre ranch in Wyoming, which supports up to 600 of the docile grazers. “You can’t do cowboy shit with bison,” he explained to DL News in an interview. “Bison just do whatever the fuck they want to do.” Hoskinson, who traces part of his family to Florence, Italy, joked that he may be related to the Medicis, the powerful banking clan who commissioned work from the likes of Leonardo da Vinci. “They had a lot of kids, man,” he said. In other words, this crypto captain of industry is a true Renaissance man. Hoskinson may not be the ruler of an Italian city state, but he certainly has capital. In 2017, he helped launch Cardano, a layer 1 blockchain that aims to challenge Ethereum, which he also helped found. While Cardano is often labelled a “zombie chain,” or blockchain with little activity compared to other layer 1s like Ethereum or Solana, the cryptocurrency is valued at $12.5 billion, according to DefiLlama. “It’s a juggernaut that will drag this industry kicking and screaming if it has to towards solving the real-world economic, political, and social issues we all face,” Hoskinson said in June, in response to claims that the blockchain isn’t relevant. Still, it’s Hoskinson’s extracurricular investments that have caught the eye of crypto users. On a recent morning in Singapore, Hoskinson spoke at length about what drives his eclectic interests. “I just love solving hard problems,” he said. Other crypto founders have also spent their fortunes on colourful purchases. Gavin Wood, another Ethereum co-founder, has invested in his DJ career. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, purchased a tank with three blacktip reef sharks for his crypto exchange’s office in Hong Kong. And Yat Siu, chairman of crypto conglomerate Animoca Brands, bought a violin once owned by Catherine the Great, the Russian empress. Yet, Hoskinson, who owns a private jet, a Blackhawk helicopter, and said his net worth is approximately $1.2 billion, stands apart as a patron of far-out projects. “I’m friends with Steve Wolfram and all these other guys,” he said, referring to the well-known computer scientist. “They always have these pet problems that they carry with them, and when you collaborate with them, you can kind of make those pet problems, your problems.” ‘If you want to solve global warming... it makes sense to get involved in genetically engineering plants.’ In person, Hoskinson doesn’t come across like a flashy Silicon Valley mogul but rather as an avuncular academic. After growing up in Hawaii, he went on to become one of the eight original co-founders of Ethereum in the early 2010s. Soon enough, tensions mounted with Vitalik Buterin, the blockchain network’s primary architect. Hoskinson wanted Ethereum’s founders to create a for-profit entity and accept venture investments. Buterin wanted to maintain a non-profit organisation. Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson is funding research in longevity science. Credit: Rita Franca/NurPhoto/Shutterstock  Later in 2014, Hoskinson left Ethereum, and, the next year, he founded, along with former colleague Jeremy Wood, Input Output, or IOHK. Styled as a general-purpose firm that did all things blockchain, IOHK’s most well-known creation is Cardano. It also has its hands in a number of other projects, including Midnight, a Cardano sidechain, as well as Daedalus, a Cardano wallet. Hoskinson’s interests aren’t just relegated to cryptography or blockchain. He also likes glow-in-the-dark plants. “If you want to solve global warming or you want to improve the environment, it makes sense to get involved in genetically engineering plants,” he said. Bespoke plants can create organic lighting as well as sequester carbon, eliminate toxic chemicals, and provide other environmental boons, he said. He showed DL News a picture on his phone showing him smiling in the dark and holding one neon green plant. Cultivated tobacco and thale cress are some of the species his team have illuminated, he said. ‘If it has a lot of THC, it glows red.’ While the Cardano founder declined to elaborate on the biological mechanisms that make his plants radiate light, he did say his team uses CRISPR, a novel technique that uses enzymes to edit genes. Hoskinson added that he’ll be able to publicly show off the plants in a year. He also alluded to bioengineering glow-in-the-dark cannabis. “If it has a lot of THC, it glows red,” he mused, referring to the active ingredient in marijuana. “If it has just a little bit, it glows green.” Hoskinson is friends with Champ Medici, Snoop Dogg’s son. Had he spoken with the weed-obsessed rapper about growing glowing ganja? “Maybe,” he said. “I can neither confirm nor deny.” Hoskinson is also big on injecting himself with stem cells, self-renewing cells that play a vital role in medical research. His father and brother are both doctors. Hoskinson invested $100 million to establish a facility in Gillette, Wyoming, called the Hoskinson Health & Wellness Clinic. It will begin conducting its first research trial monitored by the US Food and Drug Administration hopefully next year, the Cardano founder said. Hoskinson, like many wealthy tech founders, is interested in longevity science. The research trial will evaluate the efficacy of stem cell injections combined with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or when patients breathe pure oxygen in a pressurised chamber. “If my hypothesis is right, we can reverse ageing by over 10 years,” he predicted. One of the trial’s first subjects? Hoskinson himself. “I’m going to be the first guy, the very first guy,” Hoskinson said. “I’m getting fat and old and it would be nice to live a little longer and be healthier.” Doctors have already extracted his stem cells, and his microscopic Hoskinsons are already replicating in his clinic. The Cardano founder will begin to receive injections when the FDA approves clinical trials, he said. But Hoskinson’s potential rejuvenation as patient zero isn’t the only medical project he has planned. By next summer, he plans to expand his Wyoming health centre to 70,000 square feet and incorporate cardiology, radiology, and immunology practices, among others. And, like any good Medici, he’ll populate the expanded clinic with “priceless artworks.” There will be “four-dimensional objects,” an “infinity room” inspired by the legendary Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, and a diorama featuring a six-foot Godzilla. Why Godzilla? “Just because,” he said. “We went insane.” Ben Weiss is a Dubai Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email him at bweiss@dlnews.com.

Title: Five Polymarket accounts have made it seem like Trump will win the presidential election | Fortune
Date: 
Content:
In the final few weeks of the presidential race, some polls and prediction markets are indicating we could have Donald Trump back in office come January 2025. For the first time since August, the former president overtook Vice President Kamala Harris in The Economist’s statistical model of America’s presidential election, and some other news outlets and political forecasters are predicting the same outcome.  Prediction markets like Polymarket and PredictIt also show Trump winning the election, but by a much steeper margin than some of the polls. As of Wednesday, Polymarket users have indicated Trump has nearly a 64% chance of winning the election, with Harris trailing at just 36%. PredictIt shows Trump in the lead with a 59% chance and Harris at 43%.  But what’s important to remember about Polymarket is that it’s a cryptocurrency-based prediction market—and Americans aren’t even allowed to trade on the website. As a result, Polymarket is conducting checks to verify that major users on the platform are based outside of the U.S., a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.  This could be a key element in cracking the code on why Trump is seemingly pulling so far ahead of Harris, especially since only a handful of Polymarket users appear to be swaying the election odds. Starting earlier this month, four Polymarket accounts started pouring millions of dollars worth of bets that Trump would win the election.  As of Wednesday, Polymarket users Fredi9999, Theo4, PrincessCaro, and Michie had bet a collective $30 million that Trump would win the 2024 presidential election. Another Polymarket user, zxgngl, has been on a buying spree in recent days, betting more than $5 million worth of crypto on Trump retaking the Oval Office. With more than $35 million in bets being quickly poured into the presidential election market, it’s no wonder Trump appears to be ahead.  Alex Marinier, a venture capitalist who was one of the first to invest in Polymarket’s seed round in 2020, told Fortune it’s entirely possible “some large whale is placing large bets that move the market.” “They’re either super convinced that Trump would win, or explicitly to influence the market optics in favor of their candidate in an effort to help his odds of being elected,” Marinier said. “However, if the market believes that this whale bettor is, in fact, too optimistic on their candidate, then market forces should bring the market odds back to ‘correct’ market levels.” Some political and betting experts have said prediction markets are the most accurate way to foresee election outcomes because people are betting real money on a particular outcome. The way prediction markets work is that traders buy shares depending on which outcome they think is more likely. Share prices or “odds” rise and fall depending on demand, so if the event happens the way the trader predicted, the contract or “bet” will rise to $1 and pay out—or fall to $0 if it does not. “Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,” Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune’s Shawn Tully. Miller is known for his accurate calls for the 2020 election, and some of his methodology comes from examining prediction markets. But other experts aren’t so sure, particularly since Polymarket allows only users to place bets using cryptocurrency—and U.S. voters aren’t even allowed to participate.  “I could not disagree more with that thesis,” George Kailas, CEO of stock-market intelligence tool Prospero.ai, told Fortune. “People are spending money around what they want to happen, not some strong underlying logic or reason.”  Plus, given that Polymarket is crypto-based and Trump is pro-crypto, “it would seem to be an indicator that Trump supporters are just more willing to bet on him than ‘wisdom,’” Kailas adds. To be sure, Cliff Young, a pollster and president of public affairs for Ipsos, told Fortune betting markets are “about as good as the polls.” Although the “Presidential Election Winner 2024” market shows Trump with a great advantage over Harris, the “Popular Vote Winner 2024” shows Harris in the lead. Young said this could be because Trump appears to be stronger in the swing states. While “Harris leads in the national race, which has leaned Democrat over the last few decades, the swing states define the election,” Young said.  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Misspelled "Soneium" Google Search Puts Crypto Wallets at Risk: Scam Sniffer - Brave New Coin
Date: Date not available
Content:
Web3 security firm Scam Sniffer has discovered a malicious link targeting Google users searching for Sony’s new blockchain, Soneium. A simple typo could cost you your cryptocurrency. Web3 security firm Scam Sniffer has discovered a malicious link targeting Google users searching for Sony’s new blockchain, Soneium. According to Scam Sniffer, a Google-sponsored ad that appears when users search for “Soneium” but misspell it as “someium,” directing them to a fraudulent website. This site, masquerading as a legitimate link, is a crypto wallet drainer designed to steal funds. In an October 22 post on X (formerly Twitter), Scam Sniffer shared their findings: “Searched for Soneium on Google, clicked a phishing ad. Phishing always happens when you’re not paying attention, even if you mistakenly spell ‘Soneium’ as ‘someium.'”  Source: X Scam Sniffer revealed that the phishing link used a domain suffix different from Soneium’s official website. The fraudulent page appeared as a basic, unfinished site for a British-based radiology service. The creators of this malicious website employed specific tactics to avoid detection. Scam Sniffer explained, “It’s hard to see it unless you are targeted, and that’s why Google couldn’t know about it.” Soneium is Sony’s Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs, a joint venture between Sony and Startale Labs. The blockchain entered its test net phase in August 2024. Transak, a fiat-to-crypto payment gateway provider, has discovered a security breach affecting 92,554 of its users. The event resulted from a sophisticated phishing attack on one of the company’s employees. In its statement issued on October 21, the company expressed its concern over the breach. “We understand how disappointing and frustrating this situation is for our affected users,” Transak said. “Our top priority is to ensure user safety, and we are taking all necessary steps to fix any vulnerabilities and prevent such incidents in the future.”  Source: Transak According to a Transak statement, the attackers were able to get an employee’s credentials, which they then used to access the systems of a third-party KYC (Know Your Customer) vendor. For Transak, this provider manages scanning and document verification services. After entering the vendor’s platform, the attackers were able to obtain private user data kept in the dashboard. Personal information like names, birth dates, user pictures, and scanned copies of passports and other identification documents were among the compromised data. The corporation claims that 1.4% of its user base is comprised of these impacted users. The Soneium and Transak incidents are among several notable phishing attacks of this year. Earlier this month, Scam Sniffer reported that $46 million in cryptocurrency was stolen in September alone, affecting 10,800 victims of phishing scams. Over the third quarter of 2024, a staggering $127 million was stolen from crypto investors, with Ethereum wallets being a primary target. In April, Scam Sniffer highlighted a similar phishing campaign in which over $4 million was stolen in just a few weeks. Scammers purchased domain names resembling popular crypto platforms, making slight changes that tricked users into clicking on malicious links. ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, is warning small businesses to be on the lookout for more complex frauds such as investment fraud, fake billing, and remote access schemes. Companies reported 4,933 frauds to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in 2023, a 27.9% rise from the year before and $29.5 million in losses. Interestingly, $17.3 million of these losses came from small and microfirms. False billing ($11.8 million), investment scams ($6.2 million), and remote access scams ($4.9 million) caused the most damage.   Brave New Coin reaches 500,000+ engaged crypto enthusiasts a month through our website, podcast, newsletters, and YouTube.

Title: Ripple CEO Garlinghouse: I've Personally Been Debanked Because of My Crypto Ties
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has personally been severed from a longtime banking relationship because he's a prominent figure in crypto, he told an audience in Washington on Wednesday. "Individuals within the crypto industry are being de-banked," he said at DC Fintech Week. "I personally have been de-banked." Garlinghouse tied his own experience to the wider trend in the U.S. industry that's struggled to maintain banking ties as regulators have cautioned institutions to limit their crypto involvement. He later added in an interview with CoinDesk that the institution that cut him off recently was Citigroup Inc., with which he'd been a customer for about 25 years, he said. And he added that it's not the only personal banking relationship he's lost because of his role in crypto. "They said, 'You have five days to move your money," he said. "They were actually super honest. They're like, 'Look, you are a notable person in crypto, and having notable people in crypto, and banking the crypto industry means more scrutiny from federal regulators." The CEO was highly critical of President Joe Biden's administration in Washington, saying Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has led a "reign of terror," and accusing the U.S. Treasury Department and banking regulator Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of being "hostile" to the industry.  He said that whichever way the U.S. presidential elections go next month, the future for crypto policy will be better. "No matter what happens, we're going to see a reset," he said. He also said that an exchange-traded fund (ETF) pegged to the price of XRP was "inevitable" during his remarks. Garlinghouse and Ripple have been among the chief backers of the Fairshake political action committee, the pro-crypto group that has been among the dominant campaign-finance forces in the 2024 elections. Apart from personally supporting the political opponent of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), he isn't endorsing either major U.S. political party and said he was wearing a purple tie on Wednesday for a reason. The primary indicator of the next administration's crypto stance will be who the president appoints at agencies such as the SEC, Treasury, OCC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. "It'll be telling as to what the direction of travel is for the next four years," Garlinghouse said. "No matter what, we're going to end up in a better place." "When we look back on this period of time in the United States as it relates to crypto, it's going to look like a speed bump," he said. Still, when asked what advice he'd give to a crypto startup right now, he said they should incorporate outside the U.S.  "I hate saying that," he said. "I'll be honest: I grew up in Kansas. I'm a pro-U.S. guy." But he said there's too much uncertainty about protecting a company from being sued by regulators in the U.S., as Ripple was by the SEC. A Citi spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. Read More: Ripple Co-Founder Larsen Flooding Kamala Harris' Election Effort With XRP Edited by Nikhilesh De.

           As the BRICS 2024 summit convenes in Kazan, discussions on
cryptocurrency have gained prominence among member nations, aligning with
broader strategies to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Russia is developing a settlement and payment infrastructure
to bypass Western payment systems, a key element of the de-dollarization
efforts expected from the summit.  Although there has been some progress in de-dollarization,
BRICS countries still show a higher level of dollarization than the global
average of about 47% for cross-border lending and international debt
securities, highlighting the challenges ahead.  In response, Russia is advancing
its m-Bridge initiative, which uses central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for
cross-border payments, potentially reducing the U.S. dollar's dominance in
global finance. ING analysts note that "over the last four years, the
share of BRICS foreign exchange in cross-border bank claims has increased to
15%, while other emerging market currencies have risen to 19%."  If successful, m-Bridge could further diminish the dollar's
role in international finance. However, the initiative faces organizational and
governance challenges, despite interest from over thirty central banks. During the summit, Russian lawmakers encouraged miners to

Title: US hopeful for new regulations; UK defends 'crypto' approach
Date: Date not available
Content:
United States Rep. French Hill remains hopeful digital asset legislation will pass this year, despite lame-duck Congress, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) publishes its 2025 examination priorities. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom’s top finance watchdog felt the need to defend its stance on digital assets amid criticism of an overly strict approach. Congressman Hill (R-AR) said he still believes two digital asset-related bills might progress before the end of the year despite the impeding lame-duck Congress. Speaking during a conference on Tuesday, the Arkansas Republican said he is “still optimistic” that a digital asset market structure bill and legislation to regulate stablecoins could be considered before the end of the year. “I’m still optimistic that FIT21, which is the regulatory framework bill, and the stablecoin bill have possible consideration in the lame duck,” said Hill, in conversation with Dr. Christopher Brummer at the 8th Annual Washington DC Fintech Week. Brummer is the founder of DC Fintech Week and a professor of financial technology at Georgetown Law. A “lame duck” session occurs when lawmakers meet after an election but before the beginning of the new Congress. With a potentially momentous election due to take place on November 5, the new Congress will not be seated until January next year. “In all lame duck sessions, they take the direction from who wins the top of the ticket, so that will govern a bit of what we’re dealing with,” said Hill. It means that Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump will determine how the lame duck will drift. The digital asset-related bills Hill hopes to see progress are the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act, which passed a full U.S. House of Representatives vote in May, and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023, which passed Committee stage last July but has since been languishing in the House. The latter seeks to create a regulatory framework for the issuance and oversight of payment stablecoins, including, amongst other measures, defining stablecoins, mandating stablecoin issuers to obtain licenses from state regulators, and requiring issuers to maintain reserves equal to the value of the stablecoins in circulation. While lawmakers remain motivated to pass stablecoin legislation this year, FIT21 is perhaps the more significant bill. It aims to provide broader regulatory certainty for digital assets and eliminate some of the grey areas in oversight. If passed, it would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) power over digital commodities while clarifying the SEC’s mandate to oversee digital assets offered as part of an investment contract. The bill also outlines a process for firms to certify with the SEC that their projects are adequately decentralized, allowing them to register digital assets as digital commodities with the CFTC. Rep. Hill leads the House Financial Services subcommittee focused on digital assets and has also put his hat in the ring to lead the full House Financial Services Committee if Republicans remain in control of the House next year. Current Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) announced his plans to retire at the beginning of 2025. Hill said on Tuesday that if legislation doesn’t happen this year, it will be a “top priority” for next year. The comments came just a day after the SEC announced its priorities for 2025. 2025 regulatory goals On Monday, the SEC Division of Examinations—responsible for conducting inspections and oversight of financial firms, such as investment advisors, broker-dealers and other regulated entities, to ensure compliance with securities laws and regulations—published its “examination priorities” for 2025, which included plans to focus on the “offer, sale, recommendation, advice, trading, and other activities involving crypto assets.” According to the SEC, “given the volatility and activity involving the crypto asset markets, the Division will continue to monitor and, when appropriate, conduct examinations of registrants offering crypto asset-related services.” It added that “the Division will assess registrant practices to address the technological risks associated with the use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology, including risks pertaining to the security of crypto assets.” A notable addition to the 2025 examination priorities was the inclusion of spot BTC and ETH exchange-traded products (ETPs), after the SEC approved the former in January, followed by the latter in May.  The SEC’s Acting Director of the Division of Examinations, Keith Cassidy, said on Monday that the list of priorities represented “key areas of potentially increased risks and related harm for investors,” while SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the division would be “working with registrants” to help them “understand the rules” and ensure that the markets “work for investors and issuers alike.” The pair’s comments hinted that the SEC’s approach to digital assets in 2025 will be similar to its current—much criticized—approach, which some have described as excessively heavy-handed. But it’s not just the U.S. regulator that has received criticism for its supposedly harsh stance on the digital asset space, as evidenced by the U.K.’s top finance watchdog this week feeling compelled to defend its own regulatory tact. UK regulator unrepentant On Monday, across the pond, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) publicly backed its approach to regulating the digital asset industry in response to criticism that its measures are too tough and risk stifling innovation. In an October 21 post, Val Smith, the head of payments and digital assets in the FCA’s authorizations division, emphasized the importance of maintaining rigorous standards to protect consumers and preserve the integrity of financial markets. “Relaxing our standards and creating a race to the bottom also won’t ensure people and our markets are protected or even work well,” said Smith, adding that innovations quickly built on “unsafe, unregulated and untrusted foundations” are prone to collapse. The FCA has faced criticism for its high bar to entry for digital asset registrations, as well as for prolonged delays in processing registration applications. However, Smith argued that the agency’s approach is fair and proportionate to the risks posed. “We never turn applications down out of hand. But we treat the risk of firms being used for money laundering extremely seriously,” said Smith. “Allowing illicit money to flow freely can destroy lives.”  She emphasized that the FCA wants to collaborate with partners across government, industry and other jurisdictions to develop a digital asset sector “built on reliable, sturdy foundations.” “By doing this, we can help enable safety, security and sustainable growth for years to come,” said Smith. The FCA, along with the Bank of England (BoE)—the U.K.’s central bank—continue to advance the country’s long-established aim of becoming a global “crypto asset technology hub,” a goal not yet abandoned by the new Labour administration. On October 1, the FCA and BoE jointly launched the digital securities sandbox (DSS) initiative to explore how distributed ledger technology (DLT) can be used in the notary, maintenance and settlement of financial securities. “The aim of the DSS is that these securities should be capable of being used in broadly the same way as traditional securities. For example, firms should be able to use the securities issued in repurchase agreements or write derivative contracts based on securities in the DSS as they normally would any other security,” explained the FCA at the time. The DSS will operate until December 2028, with the ultimate goal of providing firms the opportunity to explore the potential of DLT “safely.” Watch: Breaking down solutions to blockchain regulation hurdles  title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="">  As the first media outlet to report on blockchain-powered applications, we provide early adopters, developers, and visionary leaders with access to emerging technological landscapes, including wallets and games.

Title: SEC Charges Crypto Market Manipulators in Fraudulent Trading Scheme – The Presidential Prayer Team
Date: October 24, 2024
Content:




 The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed fraud charges against three companies and nine individuals for engaging in schemes designed to manipulate the markets for various crypto assets sold as securities to retail investors. The SEC alleged that the involved parties created the illusion of active trading to deceive investors into purchasing these assets. The promoters hired market makers to carry out this market manipulation by artificially inflating trading volumes and prices of the crypto assets. This included using tactics such as “wash trading” to generate billions of dollars in artificial trading volume each day. 
SEC’s Division of Enforcement Deputy Director Sanjay Wadhwaof said, “Retail investors are being victimized by fraudulent activity by institutional actors in the markets for crypto assets… investors should be mindful that the deck may be stacked against them.” 
The SEC’s complaints highlighted the collaboration between the SEC and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), revealing that a crypto asset created as part of an FBI operation was also manipulated by market makers.  
As the Lord Leads, Pray with Us…

Title: Tether Founder Paolo Ardoino Says US Is Dropping the Ball on Crypto Regulation Amid Run-Up to Election - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
The founder and CEO of stablecoin company Tether (USDT) says that whoever wins in the upcoming US presidential election should support the growth of crypto. In an interview, Paolo Ardoino says that while the US has always been the world’s prominent pack leader, it is not the case when it comes to crypto. “The US has always been leading the technological development in every single field and I think that growing up, this is the first time in history that I see the US dropping ball.” Ardoino says that one of the issues that he hopes the next US president will address is crypto regulation. “Whoever will win the elections, I think it’s very important that crypto regulations—sensible crypto regulations and stable coin regulations, will come to fruition in a way that will protect the end users and will also help this incredible technology prosper and become very much the lifeline for hundreds of millions of people that lack the same opportunities of people living in the US and Europe.” He says America’s crypto regulations will have a significant impact worldwide. “The US has huge importance in this dialogue. Everyone, every single regulator in the world will look to the US for… regulations. So I hope that will come any time soon.”   Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3. Categories Bitcoin • Ethereum • Trading •

Title: Why Crypto Whales Are Piling Into Lunex and Leaving Cardano and Solana Behind | Bitcoinist.com
Date: Date not available
Content:
A great investment strategy is to follow the crypto whales. Buy what the crypto whales buy, and sell what the crypto whales sell. These investors have the tools and resources to analyze the markets to a level retail investors cannot. Currently, the Cardano price is not encouraging, and Solana is stagnant. Crypto whales are selling Cardano and holding onto Solana but buying the hot new crypto Lunex Network as fast as they possibly can.  Lunex Network is a new hybrid exchange stepping into the market, kicking sand in the face of big crypto exchanges like BNB and Uniswap.   Lunex Network’s presale has crypto whales circling, and it’s easy to see why. As a hybrid exchange, Lunex Network combines the best of centralized and decentralized platforms, offering speed, security, and user autonomy. What really has the whales excited, though, is its zero trading fees and liquidity aggregation, making it a highly efficient platform for large-volume traders. Unlike established coins like Cardano and Solana, which struggle to maintain momentum, Lunex Network offers something fresh and dynamic. With whales buying up Lunex Network at presale prices, they clearly see massive potential in this project. Early investment in Lunex could yield significant returns, making it a prime opportunity for savvy traders looking for the next big thing. According to the crypto whales, Lunex Network is a certain ‘buy’ call.  The crypto whales have jumped ship on Cardano after the Cardano price lost a massive 40% in YTD figures. Considering the market is up this year, and some coins have returned well over 100% since January, the faltering Cardano price is not encouraging for crypto whales or retail investors. Yet, the Cardano price is up in the last month, breaking its losing streak. This may look encouraging, but it could be upward price action in a low ‘buy the dip’ long-shot opportunity. Don’t expect the Cardano price to do more than it did, but if it does, the whales may have gotten this one wrong, but don’t count on it. Cardano is a ‘sell’. The Solana price is slowly creeping upwards, but not at a pace that would get anyone excited. An unkind take on the Solana price would be that the token is moving too slowly for its value proposition, and Solana should be well north of $200. The flip side of that token is that a year ago, Solana was trading at $20, so sitting at the $160 mark is one heck of an improvement.   This begs the question of whether Solana can do a 2x, let alone a 5x or the 10x crypto investors demand. Probably not. When there are faster tokens like Lunex around, Solana can provide a stable base for a crypto portfolio, but don’t expect it to shoot the moon anytime soon. Solana is a ‘hold’ call.  Swim with the crypto whales, and one will see that Solana makes a great anchor point, but the Cardano price will just drag one down. However, the Lunex Network price is positively buoyant and will make a great addition to any crypto portfolio. Lunex Network is now available at $0.0017 during its 4th presale stage.  You can find more information about Lunex Network (LNEX) here:

Title: Solana, XRP, and XYZVerse: Insights on Which Crypto Is Set to Dominate - Brave New Coin
Date: Date not available
Content:
Solana, XRP, and XYZVerse are all gaining attention in the crypto world, but which one is set to lead? Solana is showing strong price growth, XRP is moving between resistance and support levels, and XYZVerse is making waves as the new meme coin champion. Let's dive into how each of these cryptos is performing and what the experts are predicting for the future.  Solana (SOL) has been making waves recently with consistent price gains. In the last week alone, SOL’s price has jumped by 7.81%. Over the past month, it has climbed 15.38%, and looking back six months, it has risen by 15.20%. These increases reflect a steady upward momentum for the coin. Analyzing the data suggests that SOL might continue this upward trend. The current price range sits between $153.50 and $174.52. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 51.37, indicating a balanced market without extreme buying or selling pressure. A positive MACD level of 0.1794 points toward potential bullish momentum ahead. The Stochastic oscillator at 66.22 also leans towards a positive sentiment. If XRP breaks through the nearest resistance level at $0.59, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.63. This would represent an increase of around 10 to 15 percent from the current price range. On the downside, if it falls below the support at $0.51, it might test the next support at $0.47, which would be a decrease of about 10 percent. Traders are watching these levels closely to anticipate the next move.  The fans are losing it! The XYZ token is in the crypto ring, landing blows on the competition – bullshit coins, worthless farming schemes, and scam projects. Like a true champ, this first-ever all-sports meme token has fought its way through the bear market with fearless momentum and shows no signs of slowing down. With eyes set on a roaring thousand-fold growth, XYZ is destined to leave the 2024 meme coin triumphants like BOME and WIF trailing in its wake. XYZ is more than just a benchwarmer in the meme coin game; it’s creating the ultimate playing field with XYZVerse, where the thrill of sports meets the energy of meme culture. With a roadmap equipped with entertainment dApps, prediction markets, and sports betting options, XYZ is poised to draw in millions of gamblers ready to join the action. Remember Polymarket’s massive $1 billion trading volume during the US election betting fever? XYZ is gearing up for an even bigger win in the GameFi arena, letting its stakeholders cash in on the perfect combo of meme coin vibes, sports hype, and crypto mass adoption.  By capitalizing on the ever-expanding gambling niche, XYZ is set to become the G.O.A.T of meme coins. BOME’s 5,000% takeoff and WIF’s 1,000% year-to-date rally are now relics of the past because XYZ is set to explode by over 9,900% after the TGE and outshine its sensational predecessors. Get in the game early to secure your spot – currently undervalued, XYZ is going the distance to break new records! XYZVerse will be the MVP in this bull run, giving the community the control to call the plays and steer the ecosystem’s direction. Active contributors will receive airdropped XYZ tokens as a reward for their dedication. With rock-solid tokenomics and plans for both CEX/DEX listings, XYZ is positioned for a championship run, ensuring a steady revenue flow and consistent token burns to keep the scoreboard in favor of a strong price and a thriving community. >>The XYZ presale is live – don’t miss out on this knockout 99,900% opportunity!<<  XRP has seen shifts in its price lately. Over the past week, its price dropped by 3.56 percent. Looking at the past month, the decline was steeper at 11.11 percent. However, over six months, the price change was minimal, with a slight decrease of 0.53 percent. Currently, XRP is trading between $0.53 and $0.57. Technical indicators show potential for movement. The Relative Strength Index is at 32.73, suggesting the coin might be approaching oversold territory. The MACD level is negative at -0.0032, indicating a bearish trend. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $0.53, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.54. This could signal a potential change in price direction soon. If XRP breaks through the nearest resistance level at $0.59, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.63. This would represent an increase of around 10 to 15 percent from the current price range. On the downside, if it falls below the support at $0.51, it might test the next support at $0.47, which would be a decrease of about 10 percent. Traders are watching these levels closely to anticipate the next move. In summary, Solana, XRP, and XYZVerse are all in unique positions within the crypto market. Solana shows steady growth, XRP is navigating through support and resistance levels, and XYZVerse is making a big splash as a meme coin with huge potential. As the market evolves, these three cryptos are worth watching to see which one will come out on top.

Title: Crypto Analyst Issues Bitcoin Alert, Says BTC Primed To Nuke After Hitting Local Top – Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl
Date: Date not available
Content:
A widely followed crypto analyst is warning that Bitcoin (BTC) may be heading lower after tapping the $69,000 level on Sunday. Pseudonymous crypto trader Credible Crypto tells his 431,100 followers on the social media platform X that he is turning short-term bearish on Bitcoin. “I think our top is probably now in on BTC. Here’s what I think makes the most sense on lower timeframes. A bit more chopping about before we are ready to continue down ideally…  Going well so far, a bounce from this region would be ideal. Bait in a some final longs before the rug pull.” Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin may make one more run to the $68,000 level, face rejection and collapse to the $61,000 level by next week. The analyst is warning that Bitcoin may correct below $49,000. “Still expecting sub $49,000. That $58,000-$61,000 is just the last stand for bulls if they want to avoid that.”  However, the analyst expresses long-term bullish sentiment in response to an X user asking him if “liquidity is being engineered to the upside for a bigger move down the road in a few weeks (after we sweep lows)?” “Yes. That’s why the highs are being defended and why we get so close each time but fail. Those highs are being ‘saved’ for the real breakout so that when it happens it’s aggressive and there’s no looking back. A cascade of short liquidations with spot buyers relentlessly bidding. When the time is right it will be spectacular.” Bitcoin is trading for $66,455 at time of writing, down nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

Title: Crypto's Rise as a Hot Policy Issue
Date: 

      24 October 2024


       . 6:00 PM

Content:
a16zcrypto's 2024 "State of Crypto" report highlights record crypto activity, policy breakthroughs, Ethereum and Bitcoin ETPs, and tech upgrades The a16zcrypto's latest 'State of Crypto Report' examines the emergence of cryptocurrency as a popular policy subject, the numerous technological advancements made to blockchain networks, and the most current developments among cryptocurrency developers and consumers. The key takeaways from the report are listed below: The number of monthly active crypto addresses has never been higher. This number has more than tripled since the end of last year, with 220 million addresses interacting with a blockchain at least once in September. The report shows the listing of Ethereum and Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) was one element that could have increased public interest in cryptocurrencies this year. As ETPs like this increase investor accessibility, the number of Americans who own cryptocurrency may increase. The Ethereum and Bitcoin ETPs' combined on-chain holdings total $65 billion. Although these products are often referred to as ETFs, they are registered as ETPs using SEC Form S-1, indicating that the underlying portfolios are not securities. The SEC's ETP approvals mark significant turning points in crypto policy. Many legislators anticipate that momentum will increase with the approval of bipartisan crypto legislation, regardless of which party takes power in November. More and more politicians and policymakers from both parties are expressing support for cryptocurrency. This election season, cryptocurrency has entered the public conversation. This year, the industry has also sparked other noteworthy policy moves. With 208 Republicans and 71 Democrats voting in favour, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act was enacted by the House of Representatives on a bipartisan basis at the federal level. The law may give cryptocurrency businesses much-needed regulatory clarification, pending Senate consideration and passage. The EU and the UK have led public engagement with crypto policy and regulation. Several European authorities have sent far more requests for feedback than the US Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance. The first complete legislative framework pertaining to cryptocurrency to be enacted is the European Union's Markets in Crypto Act (MiCA), which is expected to take effect fully by the end of the year. With many proposals now circulating in Congress, stablecoins, which have grown to be one of the most well-liked cryptocurrency products, are among the most hotly debated legislative issues. One of the tailwinds, at least in the US, is the understanding that stablecoins may strengthen the US dollar's standing overseas even as the greenback's status as the world's reserve currency declines. The next greatest denomination, 0.20 percent in euros, is dwarfed by the fact that almost 99 percent of stablecoins are now valued in USD. The report shows that the development of underlying infrastructure is one factor contributing to the popularity and ease of use of stablecoins. Blockchain capacity is increasing, for starters. The emergence of Ethereum L2 networks and other high-throughput blockchains has allowed them to handle almost 50 times as many transactions per second as they did just four years ago. More astonishingly, after being implemented in March 2024, Ethereum's largest update of the year, "Dencun," also known as "protodanksharding" or EIP-4844, dramatically decreased costs for L2 networks. Since then, even while the value of L2s denominated in ETH has continued to increase, L2s' fees on Ethereum have drastically decreased. Put another way, blockchain networks are simultaneously becoming more and more well-liked. Only decentralised finance, or DeFi, draws more builders than blockchain infrastructure. DeFi also has the highest cryptocurrency usage rate, accounting for 34 per cent of daily active addresses. Decentralised exchanges, or DEXs, have risen to 10 per cent of spot cryptocurrency trading activity since DeFi's introduction in the summer of 2020. This was only the case in centralised exchanges four years prior. Thousands of DeFi protocols currently contain over $169 billion. Among the most popular DeFi subcategories are lending and staking. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most popular developments in tech and cryptocurrency this year. One of the topics that cryptocurrency influencers discuss the most on social media is artificial intelligence. Even more unexpectedly, a significant overlap exists between chatgpt.com visitors and visits to popular cryptocurrency websites, suggesting a close relationship between AI and cryptocurrency users. The prospects for decentralisation offered by blockchain networks are nearly the exact opposite of the centralisation-related problems with AI. Crypto initiatives are already attempting to address some of these issues today. Numerous additional prospective crypto consumer apps become feasible as transaction prices decrease and blockchain capacity increases. Consider NFTs as an example. When cryptocurrency transactions were significantly more costly a few years ago, people exchanged NFTs for billions of dollars on secondary markets. Since then, that activity has decreased, and new consumer behaviour has emerged in its stead: minting inexpensive NFT collections on social media platforms like Rodeo and Zora. This is a major change for the NFT market, which was almost unthinkable prior to a sharp drop in transaction costs. To summarise, the report questioned - What does that leave us with? Over the past year, cryptocurrency has advanced significantly in several areas, including consumer acceptance, technology, and regulation. Significant bipartisan crypto legislation was passed, and policy breakthroughs, such as the unexpected approval and listing of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETPs, occurred. The State of Crypto 2024 report tells us that significant advancements in the infrastructure occurred, from scaling enhancements to the emergence of Ethereum L2s and other high-throughput blockchains. Additionally, new applications were being developed and utilised, ranging from expanding established categories like stablecoins to investigating more recent ones like artificial intelligence, social networking, and gaming. The report says it needs to be clarified if we have reached the fifth wave of the price-innovation cycle, which is our framework for comprehending the fluctuations of the several market cycles in cryptocurrency. The report showed that, in any case, there is no denying that the cryptocurrency business has advanced significantly in the last 12 months.

Title: US SEC to prioritise crypto regulations in 2025 | Digital Watch Observatory
Date: 24 Oct 2024
Content:
Digital Watch Observatory Digital Governance in 50+ issues, 500+ actors, 5+ processes Home | Updates | US SEC to prioritise crypto regulations in 2025 Despite potential leadership changes, the SEC is committed to maintaining its regulatory approach.  The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again prioritised cryptocurrencies in its 2025 examination plans. According to the Division of Examinations, the focus will be on the offer, sale, and trading of digital assets, with particular attention to Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products. The regulator will also monitor the technological risks posed by blockchain and the security of crypto assets.

Title: Bitcoin ETF inflows resume with $192.3m as BTC rebounds from $65K 
Date: October 24, 2024 at 7:18 am
Content:

Share  On Oct. 23, investors in BlackRock’s IBIT capitalized on Bitcoin’s over 3% decline, contributing $317 million in inflows to the fund as the cryptocurrency tested a critical support level at $65,000. On Oct. 23, Bitcoin faced significant downward pressure, sliding 3.3% to close at $66,649, a sharp contrast to the 0.12% gain in the previous session. Testing buyer demand at $65,000, BTC managed to find support with a session low of $65,161 before climbing back above the $66,000 level. The broader cryptocurrency market mirrored this decline, shedding 1.45% to a total market capitalization of $2.242 trillion. This decline can be attributed to shifting sentiment driven by concerns over the upcoming US Presidential Election and the Federal Reserve’s rate trajectory. Risk assets, including Bitcoin, experienced selling pressure as investors grew wary of tightening monetary policy. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell by 1.60% as 10-year US Treasury yields surged to 4.26%, the highest since July, signaling strength in the US economy and challenging expectations for multiple Fed rate cuts in Q4 2024. As the US Presidential Election approaches, uncertainty is adding further strain on investor sentiment. Recent polls indicate Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by a narrow 1.7-point margin, though Trump has closed the gap significantly from a previous 3.7-point deficit. Despite Harris’ lead, betting platform Polymarket gives Trump a higher chance of victory, with a 59.7% probability compared to Harris’ 40.4%. A Trump presidency is expected to bring inflationary pressures, potentially leading to a more hawkish Federal Reserve stance. While this may dampen demand for riskier assets, including Bitcoin, Trump’s crypto-friendly policies could bolster longer-term demand for the digital asset.  Despite the macroeconomic uncertainties, Bitcoin rebounded from the $65,000 support level, driven by renewed inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly BlackRock’s IBIT. This came after a previous day of outflows, which saw $79.1 million exit the fund due to investor concerns that Bitcoin’s rally might be losing momentum. On Oct. 23, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $192.31 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT contributing the lion’s share of $317.47 million. This marked the fourth time in six trading days that the fund attracted over $300 million in inflows, bringing its total net inflows to over $23 billion as of Oct. 21. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Minit Trust also contributed to the positive sentiment, recording $4.71 million in inflows, while other ETF products, including ARKB, BITB, and VanEck, saw collective outflows of $129.8 million, reflecting a more cautious stance from some market participants. Despite Wednesday’s price dip, Bitcoin remains above key technical levels, including the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages, reinforcing bullish signals.  A potential breakout above the $69,000 resistance level and the Oct. 21 high of $69,402, could pave the way for a move toward the psychological $70,000 mark. Should Bitcoin successfully breach $70,000, bulls may attempt to challenge the all-time high of $73,808. However, a drop below $66,500 could reignite bearish momentum, bringing the critical $65,000 support level back into focus. A further decline below $65,000 may open the door for a deeper correction, with $64,000 as the next key support. With a 14-day Relative Strength Index reading of 60, Bitcoin has the potential to reach $70,000 before approaching overbought conditions. At press time Bitcoin (BTC) was up 0.5%, exchanging hands at $67,345.

Title: Denmark could consider taxing unrealized crypto gains: report
Date: October 24, 2024 at 8:57 am
Content:

Share  The Tax Law Council in Denmark has recommended proposing a bill to tax unrealized gains and losses on crypto assets under an inventory taxation model. According to an Oct. 23 announcement citing Danish Tax Minister Rasmus Stoklund, the proposed bill aims to address the unfair taxation of crypto investors and simplify the tax rules for crypto assets. The bill proposes a uniform tax rate of up to 42% on gains from crypto assets, which would be categorized as capital income. In the report, the council explored three potential taxation frameworks for crypto assets: capital gains tax, warehouse taxation, and inventory taxation.  The council ultimately recommended the inventory model as the go-to approach, as it streamlines the process for frequent traders and brings crypto taxation in line with other financial instruments like stocks and bonds. What stands out with this model is that it taxes both unrealized gains and losses at regular intervals, regardless of whether the assets have been sold.  This continuous taxation could level the playing field by eliminating the timing strategies some traders might use to their advantage. However, it also introduces potential issues, like being taxed on assets that haven’t been liquidated yet, which might not sit well with some investors. Further, the proposed bill would require crypto entities to report user identities and detailed transaction data to tax authorities. It would also align with European Union-wide regulations, such as MiCA and DAC8, to ensure consistent oversight, facilitate cross-border cooperation, and strengthen the ability of all member states to monitor and tax crypto transactions effectively. However, the bill would not be introduced to the parliament until early 2025, according to Stoklund, and would be subject to evaluation, with the earliest recommended implementation date set for January 1, 2026. If the bill is passed, Denmark would become the first nation to tax unrealized gains on cryptocurrencies. The recommendation follows a ruling from Denmark’s Supreme Court last year, which determined that profits from the sale of Bitcoin are taxable. Taxation of cryptocurrency gains has become a global issue as several other jurisdictions have introduced or are considering regulations to address how digital assets should be taxed. On Oct. 21, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis urged the government to introduce a tax on Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Italy is in discussions to raise capital gains tax on crypto from 26% to 42%. South Korean authorities have also considered the idea of imposing a 20% tax on crypto gains, while India has a flat income tax rate of 30% on earnings from crypto assets.

Title: Swiss Crypto Trading Firm Portofino Sees Staff Exodus After Exec Firings
Date: Date not available
Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Portofino Technologies, a Switzerland-based crypto market making firm that was given the nod earlier this year from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to serve institutional crypto clients in the U.K., has seen an exodus of staff in recent months, following the sacking of the firm’s co-founder and its head of finance. Both Portofino’s chief operating officer and co-founder, Alex Casimo, and chief financial officer, Jae Park, were fired in July. This then triggered the resignations of Vincent Prieur, the head of strategy and operations, and Shane O’Callaghan, the global head of business development, as well as a significant number of the firm’s staff. Between 10 and 12 people have left or are serving out their notices since the two executives were fired, which works out at between 30%-40% of the firm’s headcount at that time, according to a person familiar with the situation. A new CFO, Mark Blackborough, has since been hired, as well as senior sales trader Olivier Sultan. “Portofino made the decision to strengthen certain components of our leadership team to ensure we are best positioned to capitalize on what is projected to be a record year,” a spokesperson said via email. Since then, the firm has been actively recruiting and currently has four positions open. The company's headcount is back to the levels it was in the summer, the spokesperson said. Portofino, which raised $50 million in equity funding in late 2022, was founded by two former Citadel Securities leaders Leonard Lancia and Alex Casimo in 2021. Portofino CEO Lancia appears to have drawn criticism on jobs and recruitment marketplace Glassdoor, which mention a “toxic work environment.” “The CEO is inexperienced and volatile. His decisions do not favor the business, only himself,” states one review. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Title: The Latest Innovations and Solutions in Crypto Recovery - Brave New Coin
Date: Date not available
Content:
With cyber attacks and hacks an everyday occurrence in the crypto space, safeguarding digital assets is more important than ever. Fortunately, new tools and innovations are stepping up to tackle the expanding threat. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to expand, ensuring the security of digital assets has become increasingly critical. The rising value and popularity of cryptocurrencies have not only attracted investors but also sophisticated cyber threats, leading to a surge in lost or stolen digital assets. Fortunately, innovative technological solutions are emerging to address these challenges, and companies like Lionsgate Network are at the forefront of this transformative effort. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies presents unique obstacles for asset recovery. Unlike traditional financial systems, there’s no central authority to assist when crypto assets go missing. This void has created a pressing demand for advanced solutions that can help investors and businesses safeguard their digital wealth. Many victims report feeling neglected by law enforcement, often finding that their cases lack sufficient evidence to warrant investigation. Clients who have approached Lionsgate Network have shared experiences of filing complaints with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) without receiving any follow-up. One of the most significant advancements in crypto recovery is the development of sophisticated blockchain analytics tools. These technologies leverage the transparent nature of blockchain to trace digital assets’ movements across the network. By analyzing transaction patterns and identifying wallet addresses, blockchain analytics provide invaluable insights into cryptocurrency flows. Contrary to popular belief, many scammers prefer to retain stolen funds in crypto for two key reasons: they believe victims will not trace legitimate recovery services, and cashing out large sums is challenging. Lionsgate Network has been pioneering this technology, offering state-of-the-art blockchain analytics and direct collaboration with law enforcement. “We have mapped every jurisdiction in the USA, one of the most complex legal landscapes, as well as jurisdictions in Europe and Asia. This enables us to assist our clients not only with tracing capital but also with communicating their cases to law enforcement and supporting local police in issuing critical subpoenas for the recovery process,” they explain. Their tools can track lost or stolen crypto regardless of the blockchain or how many times the funds have been swapped. By following the trail of transactions, Lionsgate can potentially identify current holders of the assets, ultimately closing in on recovery. The latest generation of hardware wallets has incorporated advanced recovery features to address the issue of lost private keys. These devices now offer sophisticated backup and restoration capabilities, including seed phrase encryption and multi-signature recovery options. Some wallets even integrate biometric authentication, such as fingerprint recognition, to enhance security and simplify recovery. While hardware solutions provide robust protection, Lionsgate Network complements these efforts by offering forensic analysis services when hardware-based recovery methods fall short. At Lionsgate Network, every client is equipped with a prevention kit designed to help avoid future losses. This kit features key elements: The crypto industry recognizes the importance of collaboration in combating asset loss and theft. New platforms are being developed to facilitate information sharing among exchanges, wallet providers, and law enforcement agencies. These collaborative efforts aim to create a united front against crypto criminals and enhance asset recovery prospects. Lionsgate Network plays a crucial role in this ecosystem by providing forensic analysis that serves as evidence for law enforcement. Their expertise in digital forensics helps bridge the gap between the crypto world and traditional legal systems, making it easier for authorities to pursue cases of crypto theft and fraud. The industry is making significant strides in protecting users’ assets through advanced blockchain analytics, collaboration with law enforcement, and innovative prevention solutions. However, it is crucial to remember that prevention is always better than cure. Implementing robust security measures and staying informed about best practices in crypto management are vital steps in safeguarding digital assets. For those unfortunate cases where prevention fails, companies like Lionsgate Network are ready to provide cutting-edge solutions and forensic analysis. As the crypto ecosystem matures, we can expect even more sophisticated technologies to emerge, further strengthening the security and recoverability of digital assets. The key to success lies in the ongoing collaboration between technology providers, law enforcement agencies, and the broader crypto community. By leveraging these advancements and partnering with experienced firms like Lionsgate Network, crypto holders can gain greater peace of mind, knowing that effective means exist to track and potentially recover lost or stolen digital assets. As we move forward, the continued development of these technologies will be crucial in building trust and stability in the cryptocurrency market, paving the way for wider adoption and integration of digital assets into the global financial system.   Brave New Coin reaches 500,000+ engaged crypto enthusiasts a month through our website, podcast, newsletters, and YouTube.

Title: Ripple CEO Says He Was Debanked Due to His Crypto Ties
Date: October 24, 2024
Content:
[ccpw id="39382"] Date:  Written By:   Follow Us On Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has shared his personal encounters with US banks, noting a pattern of skepticism due to his involvement with cryptocurrencies. In a virtual interview with Bloomberg at DC Fintech Week, he noted that he and other individuals strongly affiliated with the crypto industry have faced discriminatory treatment from banks while pursuing their personal businesses. Notably, he stated that financial institutions have debanked him several times due to his crypto ties. The Ripple CEO revealed that his recent debanking scenario happened with one of the largest American banks, Citigroup. Garlinghouse noted that the leading financial institution told him to move his funds elsewhere after 25 years of banking with them. According to him, Citigroup gave him three days to withdraw his funds, citing his strong involvement with the crypto industry. The Ripple boss noted that the bank took this action to avert excessive regulatory scrutiny by US regulators. Notably, Garlinghouse stated he was not the only crypto leader facing the dilemma. He stressed that “individuals within the crypto industry are being de-banked,” as federal regulators have instructed financial institutions to sever their ties with digital assets and players involved in the nascent sector. https://x.com/thecryptobasic Furthermore, Ripple blamed the current dark US regulatory cloud on the White House. He argued that President Joe Biden has encouraged regulation by enforcement on the crypto sector, encouraging regulators to go after the digital assets industry. Garlinghouse also called out the US Securities and Exchange Commission chair, Gary Gensler, for facilitating innovation scuffing in the States. He further blamed the hash crypto regulatory climate on the Treasury Department and offices regulating the banking sector. Meanwhile, Garlinghouse expressed confidence that the unrest will be over soon, pointing to the November presidential election. He stated that the crypto industry will be better regulated regardless of the polling outcome. When quizzed about what he would advise crypto startups to do, the Ripple boss encouraged them to move abroad, where there is better regulation. He said that the unclear enforcement in the US could stiffen these startups’ growth. Notably, Garlinghouse ruled out the possibility of a Ripple initial public offering in the US last month, citing the same regulatory tussle. However, he noted he and his company will keep fighting until the coast is clear. Meanwhile, the Ripple boss also told Bloomberg that an XRP ETF was inevitable. He cited the growing institutional adoption of XRP and the impending regulatory shift as reasons behind his insistence.

Title: Millions left in limbo as Korean crypto exchanges shut down amid regulations: report
Date: October 24, 2024 at 11:27 am
Content:

Share  More than a dozen crypto exchanges in South Korea have closed or suspended operations in 2024, leaving nearly $13 million in assets unclaimed by almost 34,000 subscribers. As South Korea enforces the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, more than a dozen crypto exchanges have shut down in 2024, leaving customers with 17.8 billion won ($12.8 million) in inaccessible assets. According to data from the Financial Services Commission, 11 exchanges have permanently ceased operations, while three others have temporarily suspended services in late September, The Korea Times reports. As a result, nearly 34,000 crypto owners are now seeking to reclaim cash and crypto from the closed exchanges, which hold a combined total of 17.8 billion won, broken down into 1.41 billion won in cashable assets and 16.4 billion won in crypto, the report reads. South Korean crypto exchange Cashierest, which shut down in late 2023, emerged as the largest custodian of customer assets, holding 13 billion won, followed by ProBit with 2.25 billion won and HTX (formerly Huobi) with 579 million won. Meanwhile, approximately 30.7 billion won remain locked in three exchanges that have temporarily halted operations: Oasis (16.2 billion won), Flata Exchange (14.35 billion won), and Btrade (80 million won). Rep. Kang Min-kuk of the ruling People Power Party said more trading platforms are “likely to cease or suspend their operations during the ongoing renewal review process by the FSC” as the market is in a slump and regulatory compliance costs are on the rise. While financial authorities have issued guidelines to facilitate the return of user assets, achieving the successful recovery of all remaining funds may be challenging, Kang admitted.

Title: Denmark Set to Tax on Unrealized Crypto Gains in New Legislation
Date: 24. October 2024
Content:
The Tax Law Council of Denmark has put forward a proposal recommending tabling a bill that could see a shift to subject unrealized gains and losses of crypto assets held by Danish crypto investors to taxes as early as  January 2026. Based on a survey in Spring 2024, approximately 300,000 Danes own crypto-assets. Taxation has been a long-standing issue in Denmark mainly because a government or a central Bank does not centrally regulate cryptocurrencies. In the report, the Council recommended bringing all non-backed crypto-assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) into the existing financial taxation framework. It mentioned three models to tax crypto assets in Denmark: capital gains tax, warehouse taxation, and inventory taxation. Tax Minister Rasmus Stoklund highlighted that there have been Danes that are being heavily tasked while investing in cryptocurrency under a “Capital gains approach”. According to the Tax Law Council, under the inventory taxation model, the assets would be taxed just like other financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds. The proposed mark-to-market taxation would involve taxing the annual changes in the value of crypto assets, regardless of whether they are sold. The consequence of this for owners of crypto assets in Denmark is that they are put in a position where unrealized gains and losses are subject to taxation. According to Mads Eberhardt, a senior crypto analyst for Steno Research, he wrote on X, “the tax on unrealized capital gains would be 42%.” He added that the tax model will affect not only crypto acquired from that date but also assets obtained as far back as the genesis block of Bitcoin in January 2009. The Tax Council added that the bill would be aimed at obliging crypto asset service providers, such as crypto exchanges and crypto payment companies, to “report information about their customers’ transactions” in a manner that can be accessible to all countries in the European Union. The proposals in the report must be considered and voted on by the Danish Parliament before they are passed to be laws. Recommendations by Denmark’s Tax Council come amidst a greater drive from other jurisdictions to tighten the screws on taxes for both crypto and traditional financial assets. This move may set a precedent for other countries considering similar regulations, reflecting a broader trend of integrating cryptocurrencies into formal economic frameworks.

Just as it appears that the market is in recovery mode, the crypto liquidation figures tell a different story. Per data from CoinGlass, the total liquidation has topped $271 million, the highest thus far this week. This crypto liquidation trend encompasses established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and newer projects like NEIRO. According to the data, Ethereum is leading the crypto liquidation trend, with a total of $72.97 million lost. ETH long traders suffered the most, as the projection of a sustained uptrend failed to materialize when the price dropped from a high of $2,605 to its current level of $2,542.01.

Ethereum Keeps Plunging Against Bitcoin
Alex Dovbnya


 According to the actual figure, long traders lost $56.58 million, while short traders lost $16.4 million. Bitcoin also saw a massive liquidation totaling $56.55 million, with long traders accounting for approximately $28.62 million of the sum. The market volatility also saw $10.12 million taken from Solana via liquidation and NEIR sell-offs pegged at $6.49 million. Despite the prominent features of meme coins, the CoinGlass data confirms that assets like Shiba Inu (SHIB) have limited exposure, as their liquidation is worth less than $1 million.  There are a lot of internal ecosystem activities that are limiting the overall focus on crypto liquidations. Ethereum, for instance, has continued to garner hype concerning ecosystem enhancements. Currently, the Ethereum gas fee has continued to drop by a wide margin, presenting the network as one that is highly usable. Notably, this has the potential to reboot transactions on the protocol which, in turn, can boost ETH buy-up and, subsequently, fuel the price surge.

Title: Radiant Capital hacker moves $52M worth of crypto funds into Ethereum
Date: October 24, 2024 at 9:01 am
Content:

Share  Blockchain forensic firm PeckShield discovered wallets belonging to Radiant Capital’s exploiter transferred $52 million funds into the Ethereum network. In an Oct. 24 X post, PeckShield reported that addresses linked to the Radiant Capital hacker moved “nearly all stolen funds” from layer 2 network Arbitrum and the Binance BNB Chain into the Ethereum(ETH) network. According to PeckShield’s data, the hacker yielded a total of 20,500 Ether or worth around $52 million.  On Oct. 16, DeFi lender Radiant Capital suffered losses up to more than $50 million due to a malware attack that enabled the hackers to exploit the funds from Radiant Capital’s Arbitrum chain.  Based on information from the post-mortem report, the attackers compromised the hardware wallets of at least three Radiant developers through a sophisticated malware injection that they dubbed “one of the most sophisticated hacks ever recorded in DeFi.” #PeckShieldAlert #RadiantCapital Exploiter -labeled addresses have bridged nearly all stolen funds from #Arbitrum and #BNBChain to #Ethereum, totaling ~20.5K $ETH (worth ~$52M). pic.twitter.com/JquCL84hZl Oftentimes, criminals will move stolen funds into the Ethereum network and launder the funds through a crypto mixer to make it harder to recover the stolen funds. The same method has been used in a number of other crypto hacks and exploits this year such as WazirX, CoinStats, Orbit Chain, among others. On Oct. 23, Radiant Capital reminded users to secure their wallets by revoking approvals to affected contracts on revoke.cash. Under the post, Radiant Capital shared a list of affected contracts for users to revoke access. “This is not optional—take one minute to protect your assets by visiting revoke.cash and removing any permissions to prevent further losses!” said Radiant Capital on its post. Moreover, the decentralized finance project built on LayerZero assured that it remains “fully committed” to tracking down and freezing the stolen funds by collaborating with security experts and law enforcement on the case. According to data from PeckShield, throughout September 2024 a number of crypto players suffered losses amounting to over $120 million due to crypto hacks. Some notable hacks and exploitations involved platforms such as BingX, Penpie, and Indodax.

Title: Consensys appeals for pro-web3 regulation in open letter to future US president
Date: October 24, 2024 at 8:59 am
Content:

Share  Blockchain infrastructure provider Consensys has issued an open letter to the next U.S. president, urging a regulatory framework that supports blockchain innovation. Ethereum-focused blockchain developer Consensys has called on the future U.S. administration to prioritize regulatory clarity and foster innovation in the crypto sector as the 2024 presidential election approaches. In an open letter, on Wednesday, Oct. 24, the company, which owns MetaMask and Infura, addressed to the “next U.S. president” concerns over what it describes as a fragmented approach to crypto regulation in the United States, which it argues “leaves room for bad actors to proliferate.” “The industry’s commitment to advancing progress, accountability, and equitable access should be protected and nurtured by its governing bodies.” Consensys The letter outlined three core imperatives for the incoming administration: ensuring regulatory transparency, enhancing consumer protection, and encouraging technological development in the blockchain space.  Consensys emphasized that regulatory ambiguity has led to “disingenuous enforcement actions.”, urging collaboration between Congress and regulatory bodies to define clear rules that allow for legitimate participation in the web3 ecosystem. “Contrary to the mistaken belief that this technology is unimportant or ephemeral, blockchain and cryptocurrency have been embraced across the United States (and the world), even as the lack of a regulatory framework in the U.S. and the ongoing threat of often haphazard and disingenuous enforcement actions against organizations that have carefully followed the law leaves room for bad actors to proliferate.” Consensys In closing, Consensys urged the future U.S. president to adopt key imperatives, driving a “more hopeful future for these technologies and all those whose livelihoods depend upon them.” Consensys is not the only blockchain company seeking regulatory clarity from regulators. Consensys is not alone in seeking regulatory clarity. Earlier in October, 21Shares urged the European Securities and Markets Authority to provide “much-needed clarity” for retail and institutional crypto investors across Europe. The Zurich-based firm highlighted that while some countries, such as Germany and Malta, permit UCITS funds to hold crypto, others, like Luxembourg and Ireland, do not, resulting in a fragmented approach that creates “confusion, making it difficult for investors to understand and compare their options.”

Title: XRP ETF From Ripple: The Crypto Ready For An Imminent Takeoff!
Date: Date not available
Content:

Discover our Read to Earn Program
 Home » News » Crypto News The eyes are now fixed on Ripple and its crypto XRP. As regulators begin to yield under the pressure of institutional investors, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently claimed that an XRP ETF is “inevitable”. This announcement, set against the backdrop of a legal battle with the SEC, has sparked unprecedented interest in what such a development could mean for the crypto market. But what does this bold prediction really hide? Crypto ETFs are no longer a novelty for investors. Since Bitcoin paved the way by becoming the first crypto asset to obtain an ETF in the United States in January, the numbers speak for themselves: massive adoption, capital flowing in, and a growing credibility for cryptocurrencies. In just a few months, Bitcoin has reached dizzying heights, partly driven by this long-awaited approval. Ethereum has closely followed, solidifying its place in the portfolios of institutional investors. However, XRP might well be the next big crypto to ride this wave. According to Garlinghouse, it’s only a matter of time before Ripple joins the select group of cryptos with an ETF. This statement is not just a simple marketing forecast, but a clear reading of current market trends. The enthusiasm around ETFs and the evolving expectations of investors regarding the diversification of digital assets make it a hard-to-ignore opportunity. Yet, a shadow hangs over Ripple: its showdown with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although this conflict has dampened the fervor of some investors, it has not hindered Garlinghouse’s determination. According to him, the approval of an XRP ETF could not only restore confidence in the asset but also mark a decisive step toward institutional recognition of cryptos in general. Investors are already looking beyond this conflict. In October, Bitwise filed a request for an XRP ETF with the SEC, reinforcing the idea that the market is preparing for this eventuality. The seventh largest crypto by market capitalization seems to have all the cards in hand to turn this trial into an opportunity. Garlinghouse also pointed out: “The approval of the Bitcoin ETF has shown that the demand for crypto products was real and growing.”
 The potential arrival of an XRP ETF represents much more than just an investment product. It could trigger a real boom for Ripple, boosting its capitalization and increasing investor confidence. But even more, it would mean that the crypto market is entering a new phase of maturity, where derivative products are viewed as legitimate diversification instruments. Ripple also invested in its stablecoin, RLUSD, earlier this month with a view to becoming a key player in the global transaction market, particularly at the business level, as Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, explains: “RLUSD has its own strengths. Ripple has consistently focused on providing blockchain solutions for banks and large financial institutions. RLUSD is designed as an enterprise-grade stablecoin, which could attract institutional investors and businesses that have concerns about USDT’s transparency and compliance. Thus, Ripple’s RLUSD may compete with USDT in specific sectors, especially in markets that prioritize compliance, enterprise applications, and integration with existing Ripple technologies.“ The XRP ETF could thus become the spark that ignites a new golden age for crypto. If Garlinghouse’s predictions come true, the market could witness a radical transformation in the perception of XRP and Ripple. But one thing is for sure: the world of crypto is ready for an imminent takeoff. Meanwhile, Musk rings the alarm bell. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our "Read to Earn" program!

Title: Japan's strict crypto regulations hold back ETF adoption | Digital Watch Observatory
Date: 24 Oct 2024
Content:
Digital Watch Observatory Digital Governance in 50+ issues, 500+ actors, 5+ processes Home | Updates | Japan’s strict crypto regulations hold back ETF adoption Japan faces increasing pressure to align with global trends as other markets advance in embracing crypto ETFs.  Japan’s financial regulators remain cautious about approving spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), even as other markets like the US and Hong Kong move forward with similar products. Oki Shiozawa, investment director at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, explained that Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is conservative and not yet ready to allow such ETFs, despite global advancements. While Japan aims to position itself as a crypto-friendly hub, strict regulations and high tax rates have limited the growth of digital assets. Crypto gains in Japan are taxed as high as 55%, compared to the 20% tax rate for traditional assets like ETFs. Keisuke Kimura, from the Japan Cryptoasset Business Association, noted that past scandals, like Mt. Gox, have made both regulators and the public wary of crypto investments. Despite the challenges, companies like Franklin Templeton and SBI Holdings are preparing for potential regulatory shifts, while others, like Nomura, have already launched crypto-related products for institutional investors. As global markets embrace crypto ETFs, Japan faces increasing pressure to adapt.

Title: Crypto: New Peak Of Dogecoin! Technical Analysis As Of October 24, 2024 - Cointribune
Date: Date not available
Content:

Discover our Read to Earn Program
 Home » News » Finance News As the crypto market has regained strength, Dogecoin shows promising interest. Let’s explore the upcoming prospects for the DOGE price. After sinking to $0.08, Dogecoin sparked buyer interest that has been upheld. Indeed, the crypto then underwent a consolidation period, forming a double bottom. The neckline of this latter was eventually breached, bringing the price of Dogecoin toward $0.13. The DOGE then endured a sudden drop before forming new support at $0.10. It is interesting to note that the latter is at the same level as a notable value area. As the crypto market was revised upwards, Dogecoin rebounded sharply. This increase allowed the crypto to surpass its previous peak as well as its first pivot resistance. Recently, Dogecoin reached the resistance of $0.15, situated at the same level as the annual VWAP. At the time this text is written, the DOGE price is trading slightly below $0.14. The crypto has thus experienced a slight decrease in its price. Although this may be concerning, it does not question the medium and long-term trend. These remarks can be confirmed by the fact that the DOGE is positioned above its 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages. Nevertheless, it will be necessary for the price of Dogecoin to maintain its momentum to allow the daily moving averages to cross upwards, which would reinforce this idea. On the crypto’s dynamics front, it shows a recovery, as evidenced by both its price and its oscillators. The current technical analysis has been conducted in collaboration with Elie FT, a passionate investor and trader in the cryptocurrency market. Today, a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of self-traders active since 2017. You will find live sessions, educational content, and mutual assistance around financial markets in a professional and warm atmosphere. The open interest of DOGE/USDT perpetual contracts has been revised upwards, just like its underlying. This undeniably demonstrates the interest of speculators in the crypto. Although this phenomenon is accompanied by a positive funding rate, indicating a dominant buying force on Dogecoin perpetuals, it is worth noting that the CVD has recently been revised downwards. This reveals recent predominant sell orders in the market, thus illustrating a certain pessimism regarding the short-term future of the crypto. Regarding liquidations, it can be seen that they are not truly significant, although the last ones have been primarily buyers, demonstrating a potential capitulation of the buyers. The heatmap of liquidations for DOGE/USDT contracts reveals that the Dogecoin price has sparked selling interest, leading to a decline as it approached the liquidation zone identified just below $0.15. Currently, the crypto is located just above a liquidation zone around $0.13. Below, various liquidation zones can be noted down to $0.114. Even lower, there are also liquidation zones below $0.10, but these are much less significant. The price approach to these levels could lead to a massive triggering of orders, thus increasing the risk of heightened volatility for the cryptocurrency. These zones thus represent crucial points of interest for investors. After a consolidation followed by a rebound, Dogecoin shows signs of recovery despite a slight recent decline. The underlying trend remains positive in the medium and long term, supported by the current market dynamics. To confirm this trajectory, maintaining momentum will be crucial. Thus, it will be essential to closely monitor the price response at key levels to validate or revise the current forecasts. Finally, let us remember that this analysis is based solely on technical criteria, and that the price of cryptocurrencies can evolve rapidly based on other more fundamental factors.

Title: Near token could surge 225%, crypto analyst predicts
Date: October 24, 2024 at 12:57 pm
Content:

Share  Near Protocol token remains in a strong bear market after falling by almost 50% from its highest level this year. Near (NEAR) was trading at $4.62 on Oct. 24, as Bitcoin (BTC) and most altcoins remained under pressure. However, Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto analyst with over 700,000 followers on X, predicted that it will soon bounce back and move to between $10 and $15. If it rises to the upper side of his forecast, it would mean a 225% increase from the current level. The markets are gearing up for the next big leg upwards.$NEAR is a perfect example.It retested the previous consolidation area and is slowly crawling upwards.The next target in the rally is $10-15. pic.twitter.com/9tewdd6tQH Near Protocol, a layer-1 blockchain network using sharding technology to accelerate performance, has struggled this year and has underperformed compared to other newer networks. Data from DeFi Llama shows that its total value locked in the DeFi industry stood at $231 million, down from the year-to-date high of $323 million. The biggest dApps in the ecosystem are Burrow, LiNEAR Protocol, Meta Pool Near, and Ref Finance. Near’s TVL is significantly lower than other newer layer-1 and layer-2 networks. For example, Base Blockchain, launched in 2023 by Coinbase, has gained $2.43 billion in assets. Similarly, Sui has gained $1.01 billion, while Arbitrum holds $2.34 billion. Near Protocol also has a small market share in the Decentralized Exchange industry. DEX networks in its ecosystem handled transactions worth $26.3 million, making it smaller than chains like Mint, Injective, and Blast.  This performance is partly due to Near Protocol’s lack of a meme coin ecosystem, which has propelled Solana (SOL) to become the largest DEX blockchain this year. On the positive side, Near handles substantial transactions each week. Data from Dune Analytics shows that it processed 49.2 million transactions in the last seven days, while the number of weekly active addresses rose by 11% to 11.55 million. The daily chart shows that the Near Protocol token has consolidated in recent days. It has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern that is nearing its confluence level. This triangle formed during an uptrend, meaning it may be seen as a bullish pennant chart pattern. A pennant is a popular continuation signal. NEAR has also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which often leads to more upside. For this to happen, Near will need to rise above the 50% Fibonacci retracement point at $5.012 and the 200-day moving average at $4.88.

Title: Scammer who stole 4,100 Bitcoin appears in US court charged with wire fraud

Content:
Malone Lam and co-conspirator exploited victim's trust through fake support calls, extracting over $274 million in crypto. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Singaporean national Malone Lam has appeared in court in the United States after being charged for allegedly stealing over 4,100 BTC, currently valued at approximately $274 million, from a private investor in Washington, according to local media. Lam, 20, and his co-conspirator, Jeandiel Serrano, 21, are accused of executing a sophisticated social engineering scheme that marks one of the largest crypto thefts from an individual in US history. According to the unsealed indictment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Lam and Serrano identified the victim as a high-net-worth crypto investor. They orchestrated unauthorized access to the victim’s Google account notifications, making it appear that security breaches originated from overseas. On Aug. 18, they contacted the victim, impersonating Google support staff, and convinced him that his account had been compromised. Gaining the victim’s trust, they obtained security codes to access his personal accounts. Lam allegedly accessed the victim’s OneDrive and Gmail accounts, locating sensitive crypto and records from the Gemini exchange. The conspirators then posed as Gemini security team members, persuading the victim to transfer approximately $3 million in crypto to a wallet under their control for supposed safekeeping. Taking the scheme further, they instructed the victim to download a remote desktop application, granting them real-time access to his computer. This allowed them to extract private keys to over 4,100 BTC, effectively transferring the substantial holdings into their possession. Lam continued to search the victim’s accounts for additional information to facilitate the theft. Court documents reveal that Lam and Serrano laundered the stolen funds through various crypto exchanges, rapidly converting them across digital assets like Litecoin, Ethereum, and Monero to obfuscate the transactions. Serrano created an account on the TradeOgre exchange without a VPN, depositing approximately $29 million worth of crypto. Records traced this account to an IP address registered at Serrano’s residence in Encino, California, a property rented for $47,500 monthly. Following the theft, Lam reportedly went on an extravagant spending spree. Authorities observed him at nightclubs in Los Angeles and Miami, spending between $400,000 and $500,000 per night and attempting to pay in crypto. Receipts indicate a single night’s expenditure exceeding $569,000. He also amassed a collection of luxury automobiles, some valued at up to $3 million. During raids, officers seized nine cars and high-end watches, one worth $1.8 million, from properties rented by Lam in Miami. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT facilitated the arrest of Lam and Serrano, contributing to tracing the stolen funds and identifying the perpetrators. The investigative work highlighted the vulnerabilities exploited through advanced social engineering tactics within the crypto space. As noted in the indictment, Lam and Serrano communicated using online monikers such as “Anne Hathaway,” “$$$,” “VersaceGod,” and “@SkidStar” to coordinate their activities. The case draws parallels to an incident involving billionaire Mark Cuban, who experienced a similar security breach in June. Cuban reported that his Google account was compromised after receiving a call from someone impersonating Google support, leading to unauthorized access attempts. While Cuban recovered his account within 24 hours without significant financial loss, the incident emphasizes the growing threat of social engineering attacks targeting high-profile individuals in the crypto industry. According to court documents, Lam has admitted to additional crypto thefts and fraud schemes. He and Serrano face charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, each carrying potential sentences of up to 20 years in prison and fines up to twice the amount gained from the illicit activities.

Title: Denmark's Bold Move: Taxing Unrealized Crypto Gains from 2026
Date: Date not available
Content:
Crypto tax rules face major changes in Denmark. The Tax Law Council has proposed a 42% tax on unrealized cryptocurrency gains. This 2026 crypto bill marks a shift toward inventory taxation for all digital assets held since 2009. The change targets Denmark’s 300,000 crypto holders. Also Read: Visa and PayPal Boost Stablecoin Adoption as Chainlink, Swift Hit Milestones The Tax Law Council explains: “The so-called inventory taxation occurs as capital income and in return implies that the taxation occurs continuously, regardless of whether crypto-assets have been sold.” The model works simply: “In an inventory taxation model, assets can be combined into one inventory. This means that purchases and sales made during the year can be calculated at inventory level, after which it is the change in value of the total inventory that is taxed.” Denmark’s tax minister, Rasmus Stoklund, states the purpose clearly: “Throughout recent years, there have been examples of Danes who have invested in crypto-assets being heavily taxed. The council’s recommendations can be a way to ensure more reasonable taxation of crypto investors’ gains and losses.” Also Read: Shiba Inu Forecasted To See Explosive 330% Growth: How High Could It Go? The proposal notes: “The three models thus all have advantages and disadvantages. With reference to the starting point for the recommendations, including the purpose of recommending a model that accommodates large trading volumes in a volatile market, a weighty consideration seems to be the calculation method.” Stoklund adds: “It is my opinion that there is a need for clearer and more appropriate rules in the area. That is why I am also looking forward to putting forward a bill and discussing it with the parties in the Folketing.” Also Read: Apple (APPL) Q4 Earning Report: Should You Buy It As Stock Targets $300?

Title: The Biggest Crypto Collapse, 300 Billion Dollars Evaporated In 72 Hours!

 Home » News » Crypto News In May 2022, the crypto world experienced one of its biggest debacles with the spectacular collapse of Terra LUNA, wiping out over 40 billion dollars in value in just 24 hours. This disaster, which shook the entire ecosystem, will be etched in history as one of the biggest crashes in digital asset history. On May 7, 2022, the Terra ecosystem, created by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin, was still dominating the crypto market from its offices in Singapore. Its algorithmic stablecoin UST, intended to maintain a perfect parity with the US dollar, had a market capitalization of 18 billion dollars, while the LUNA token peaked at 119 dollars. The Anchor protocol, the cornerstone of the system, attracted investors with staggering returns of 20% per year on UST deposits. But in the span of 48 hours, the unthinkable happened. A massive wave of withdrawals exceeding 2 billion dollars caused UST to falter, breaking its parity with the dollar. This initial crack triggered a catastrophic domino effect: the more UST dropped, the more the algorithmic mechanism created new LUNA tokens, driving their value towards zero. The desperate attempt by the Terra Foundation Guard to deploy its Bitcoin reserves to stabilize the system proved futile. In less than 72 hours, LUNA and UST collapsed, obliterating the savings of thousands of investors. The shockwave from this disaster quickly spread beyond the borders of the Terra ecosystem. Major industry players like Celsius, Voyager, and Three Arrows Capital successively declared bankruptcy, victims of their exposure to the disaster. The total market capitalization of the crypto market thus plummeted by over 300 billion dollars. For Do Kwon, the architect of this debacle, the fall was as brutal as it was spectacular. After fleeing South Korea, he was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 with false documents. South Korean and American authorities are now disputing his extradition, accusing him of massive fraud and market manipulation. His attempt to revive with Terra 2.0 only intensified investor distrust, already burned by his false statements and the mysterious transfer of 40,000 bitcoins to unidentified wallets. In summary, the collapse of Terra LUNA will remain a brutal warning about the dangers of overly complex financial systems and unrealistic return promises. This catastrophe has forced the crypto industry to reconsider itself, pushing for more transparency and regulation. In an ever-evolving market, this debacle reminds us that behind technological innovations and promises of easy gains, economic fundamentals ultimately prevail. Crypto finance will have to learn lessons from this to rebuild on stronger foundations. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our "Read to Earn" program!

Title: PropiChain Named the Only Crypto AI Platform with a Shot at Disrupting the $300 Trillion Real Estate Sector, Here’s Why
Date: 24. October 2024
Content:
PropiChain (PCHAIN) is an emerging platform reshaping the real estate industry by utilizing crypto AI and the power of DeFi to transform it. The real estate industry has been thriving for a long time and is worth hundreds of trillions. However, PropiChain believes it could be worth more if it were more accessible to small investors and did not have cross-border investment-related issues. Let’s look at how PropiChain is bringing its vision to life. The conventional method of real estate investments needs to be updated. It poses many problems, such as significant transaction costs, opaque pricing, high risk of fraud, and reliance on intermediaries like escrow agents, lawyers, and brokers. PropiChain aims to revolutionize the real estate by utilizing blockchain, crypto AI, NFTs, and the Metaverse. All transactions are stored digitally on the blockchain to maintain transparency and security. The properties are tokenized into NFTs for trading on the blockchain. These NFTs represent various parts of a property, allowing property investments with small capital. This, in turn, also increases liquidity and allows more diversification. The metaverse allows users to assess properties virtually without visiting them, breaking the geographical barrier and increasing accessibility. It provides an immersive experience of the place to remove doubts before making an investment decision. PropiChain incorporates smart contracts to automate the leasing process and eliminate the endless paperwork.  You no longer need middlemen who take time and charge high fees to guide you through the lease process. The leases created using smart contracts are legally binding and can’t be tampered with on the blockchain. Rental payments can be automated similarly to avoid making manual payments every month. The rent can be deposited by transferring funds directly between the tenant and landlord by linking their wallets via smart contracts. Along with all these features, PropiChain’s most noteworthy characteristic is its use of crypto AI to enhance user experience. Let’s understand how the AI tools in its platform help reduce human error and save time and effort. PropiChain takes real estate investment to the next level using robust AI features in its platform. Crypto AI takes care of all the complex processes and offers users a wonderful property investing experience. Crypto AI analyzes large datasets of historical property transactions from verified sources. It understands the patterns and trends in the data to generate market predictions, such as the potential degree of fluctuations and changes in valuation and demands. Users can leverage the crypto AI to automate transactions by setting specific conditions, such as the price at which they wish to purchase a property. The transactions will be executed based on the set price, and the details will be stored in the decentralized ledger. PropiChain’s crypto AI will also provide property suggestions and real-time valuations based on user search and investment patterns. Additionally, virtual AI assistants and chatbots provide 24/7 support, guide them throughout the transaction process, and answer any questions or doubts. In this way, AI simplifies and streamlines property selection and transaction processes.  The platform’s native token is PCHAIN, which brings the entire ecosystem to life. It powers everything, from essential transactions to critical features. Token holders get discrete access to advanced crypto AI and DeFi features. The token is available for purchase in stage one of the presale for $0.004. The prices are set to increase to $0.011 and $0.023 in the second and third stages. The token gives the early investor over 800% benefits on their investment, as it is projected to list at $0.032. This means investing early in the PCHAIN presale with a portfolio of $1000 will provide enormous returns and flip the initial capital to $8000. PropiChain is changing how real estate investments are made using blockchain, crypto AI, and the Metaverse.  Blockchain ensures security and transparency. Crypto AI automates menial and repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and save user effort. The Metaverse allows a virtual check of properties. Smart contracts take care of the lease-related processes. The PCHAIN token presale is live. By participating in the early presale stages, investors can maximize their chances of gaining 800% ROI.

Title: DMM Crypto and Neoclassic Lead the Charge for Web3 Gaming Growth
Date: 24. October 2024
Content:
By means of strategic alliances and large expenditures, DMM Crypto, a crypto division of DMM.com, is positioning itself as a major participant in the Web3 scene. The startup has worked with Neoclassical Capital on a fundraising round meant to quicken its Web3 projects. Targeting sectors like blockchain gaming and NFTs especially, this collaboration is part of DMM Crypto’s larger vision to create a seamless multi-chain ecosystem that merges entertainment with blockchain technology. Tokyo, Japan, – DMM Crypto, a subsidiary of the Japanese tech giant https://t.co/PJstXM5Npf, has announced a significant milestone in its expansion strategy by securing a global strategic investment round led by Neoclassic Capital. Alongside this investment, the company has also… pic.twitter.com/y4ICr1pO8G — Rocco Strydom 🤜🔥 (@sgmpodcst) October 22, 2024  The Seamoon Protocol is the core concept of this idea, which DMM Crypto launched in 2023. By distributing a range of digital assets and games, including Kanpani☆Girls RE, KamiyagURA, and Crazy Poker Zone, it seeks to link blockchain with traditional gaming. These products appeal to a wider audience by combining NFT components with popular gaming forms, therefore promoting Web3 economy involvement. Using DMM’s vast user base of over 41 million members, the approach also aims to encourage Web3 adoption not only in Japan but worldwide. This increasing attention on blockchain applications motivated by entertainment shows how businesses like DMM Crypto are trying to distribute digital ownership and gaming experiences. Aiming to lower the obstacles to access for ordinary consumers who might be ignorant of the complexities of crypto and blockchain, their method combines NFT games with blockchain technologies. Accelerating the broad acceptance of Web3 technologies depends on such projects, especially as DMM investigates innovative approaches to draw in classic players into the Web3 environment. Although DMM Crypto mostly concentrates on games, their collaborations point to a more expansive Web3 vision. They are setting the path for the next stage of the digital economy by tying entertainment with creative blockchain solutions. Should these initiatives be successful, digital assets and blockchain technologies could become the pillars of user interaction in a new era of entertainment. Beside that, major advancements are happening outside of DMM Crypto in the larger Web3 domain. For instance, as we previously reported, the ecosystem of Filecoin keeps growing, with more than 60 companies developing distributed storage, artificial intelligence, DePIN, and Web3 architecture. Its most recent Fast Finality change lowers finalizing times from hours to minutes, hence improving scalability and efficiency.

Fintech Week this afternoon, the crypto executive appeared to compliment what he saw as the sophistication of Harris’ approach to digital assets, in contrast with the strategy of her election opponent, former president Donald Trump.  “Obviously, Trump came out early and very aggressively… and said he’s the crypto president,” Garlinghouse said. “Kamala and Team Harris have been more nuanced.” The Ripple chief went on to laud Harris for announcing last week that she would support a crypto regulatory framework if elected, calling the statement “most constructive.” While Garlinghouse conceded that Vice President Harris has been “relatively quiet” about crypto compared with Trump, he framed the Democratic nominee as a “pro-technology” leader with roots in Silicon Valley.  Thus, even though the Ripple CEO insisted that the upcoming presidential election will be the most crucial in crypto’s history, he maintained that either a Harris or Trump victory would spell good news for the industry compared to the current regime. “I think no matter what happens, we’re going to see a reset, we’re going to see forward progress,” Garlinghouse said. “No matter what happens, we’re going to leave behind a failed approach from the Biden Administration.” In recent days, Ripple has come under increased scrutiny within the industry for its leadership’s political allegiances. On Monday, one the company’s co-founders, Chris Larsen, announced that he personally donated an additional $10 million worth of XRP to aid Harris’ campaign, after donating $1 million in August. XRP is a cryptocurrency that Ripple’s founders helped create and that the company utilizes in its money-moving tools. Some in the industry criticized the donations, given Trump’s months of campaign trail appeals to crypto projects and holders. Nic Carter, an emerging tech-focused VC and a prominent voice on Crypto Twitter, lambasted Larsen’s financial backing of Harris as “completely baffling.”  Is this satire? Wtf? — Stevosluck (@1song2more) October 21, 2024  But Garlinghouse quickly chimed in to support the contribution, emphasizing that he respected the right of any Ripple employee to support “whomever they think is best to lead the U.S.” I respect Chris’ (and everyone’s!) right to support whomever they think is best to lead the U.S.  We need to immediately change course from this administration’s misguided war on crypto.  Ripple will continue to engage with both Democrats and Republicans in the final days of… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) October 21, 2024  The Ripple CEO maintained on Wednesday that he would not endorse either presidential candidate before November. But the position he’s staked out for himself, and for Ripple, has already made a few waves within the industry.

Title: 5 Exclusive Crypto Presales You Can't Miss for 1000x Returns - Crypto News Flash
Date: 24. October 2024
Content:
The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, offering new opportunities for investors to potentially achieve significant returns. Crypto presales, in particular, have gained attention as a way to get in early on promising projects. These initial coin offerings allow investors to purchase tokens before they hit major exchanges, often at discounted prices. This article explores five exclusive crypto presales that deserve consideration for those seeking high-return investments. From innovative marketplaces to community-driven meme tokens, these projects aim to bring fresh ideas to the blockchain space. Readers will learn about Artemis (ARTMS), Pepe Unchained, Crypto All-Stars, Flockerz, and SpacePay – each offering unique features and potential for growth in the rapidly changing crypto landscape. Artemis (ARTMS): The First Innovative Crypto Marketplace  Artemis (ARTMS) aims to revolutionize the cryptocurrency landscape by creating a decentralized marketplace for digital transactions. This innovative project seeks to become the eBay or Amazon of the crypto world, offering a platform where buyers, sellers, and service providers can engage in seamless exchanges using various cryptocurrencies. The core of Artemis’ innovation lies in its planned marketplace, set to launch in Phase 4 of the project’s development. Users will be able to purchase tangible items like smartphones using cryptocurrencies, sell personal items such as used bicycles, and even pay for services including medical consultations, legal assistance, and freelance work. Artemis Presale Success The Artemis presale has gained significant traction in the crypto community. It has raised an impressive USD 640,000 in its funding round, with the token price increasing by 148% during the presale stage. This success has been attributed to the project’s innovative approach and its ability to secure listings on seven major exchanges before the ICO, a feat unprecedented in the crypto presale landscape. Artemis Price Prediction As Artemis continues to develop its platform and expand its user base, experts predict substantial growth potential. By 2024, the coin’s value could reach between USD 0.01 and USD 0.02. Looking further ahead to 2025, as the marketplace gains traction and integrates with DeFi services, the average price could rise to USD 0.02, with a potential high of USD 0.07. How to Participate in Artemis Presale To join the Artemis presale, interested investors can follow these steps: Pepe Unchained: Revolutionizing Meme Coins Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has emerged as a standout investment opportunity in the crypto presale landscape, building on the legacy of the iconic Pepecoin while introducing innovative elements. This new addition to the memecoin universe has gained significant traction, raising an impressive USD 22 million in its presale. What sets Pepe Unchained apart is its commitment to community-driven growth and decentralized governance. By giving token holders a direct say in the project’s future direction, PEPU fosters a sense of ownership and engagement crucial for long-term success. This approach has helped build a loyal community and drive the token’s value. The project’s ambitious plans include creating an entire ecosystem for retail traders, centered around a layer-2 network called Pepe Chain.  Crypto All-Stars: The Meme Coin Staking Platform Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) has emerged as a groundbreaking project in the crypto presale landscape, aiming to transform the meme coin sector. This innovative platform introduces the first-ever ‘MemeVault’ ecosystem, which unites various meme coin communities under one roof. The project has gained significant traction, raising over USD 2.60 million in its presale. At the heart of Crypto All-Stars is the MemeVault protocol, which allows users to stake popular meme coins like DOGE, SHIBA, and BONK to earn substantial rewards. This unique approach offers a new avenue for generating passive income from playful tokens, making it an attractive option for investors seeking to maximize returns in the volatile crypto market. Flockerz: Community-Driven Meme Token Flockerz ($FLOCK) has emerged as an innovative meme coin project, introducing a unique vote-to-earn mechanism that empowers its community members and investors. This ERC-20 token allows holders to participate in crucial project decisions, rewarding them based on their voting contributions. At the heart of Flockerz is the FlockTopia DAO, which drives the vote-to-earn model and transforms how meme coins can offer decentralized utility and governance. The Flockerz crypto project aims to take decentralization to the next level in the meme coin market. By holding $FLOCK tokens, community members can vote on key aspects such as new token features, marketing initiatives, token burning campaigns, and project developments. This approach not only fosters a sense of ownership but also creates a new demand stream that sets Flockerz apart from other meme coins in the crypto presale landscape. SpacePay: The Future of Decentralized Payments SpacePay, a London-based fintech startup, has emerged as a promising contender in the crypto presale landscape. This innovative platform aims to revolutionize cryptocurrency payments by offering a secure and efficient solution for both merchants and consumers. SpacePay’s unique approach addresses several key challenges in the crypto payment sector, making it an attractive option for investors seeking the best crypto presales in 2024. One of SpacePay’s standout features is its ability to mitigate cryptocurrency volatility risks for merchants. The platform instantly converts crypto payments into the merchant’s preferred fiat currency, ensuring they receive the agreed-upon amount regardless of market fluctuations. This feature addresses a major concern that has hindered widespread adoption of crypto payments in retail settings. SpacePay’s compatibility with over 325 crypto wallets and existing Android-based point-of-sale terminals significantly lowers the barrier to entry for merchants.  Conclusion The crypto presale landscape offers a diverse range of opportunities for investors seeking high-return potential. From Artemis’s innovative marketplace to Pepe Unchained’s community-driven approach, each project brings unique features to the table. Crypto All-Stars, Flockerz, and SpacePay further showcase the variety in this space, targeting different niches within the crypto ecosystem. These presales highlight the ongoing evolution and innovation in the cryptocurrency market. As the crypto industry continues to mature, presales like these play a crucial role in shaping its future. They provide early access to potentially groundbreaking projects and offer investors the chance to be part of something new from the ground up. While the potential for high returns is enticing, it’s essential to approach these investments with caution and thorough research. The crypto market’s dynamic nature means that while opportunities abound, so do risks. In the end, informed decision-making is key to navigating this exciting and ever-changing landscape.  About us

Title: Crypto Traders Apparently Spam Truth Terminal Into Pumping Coin Associated With Brian Armstrong’s Dog
Date: Date not available

Election 2024 coverage presented by RUSSELL, a meme coin, briefly rallied Wednesday after the AI bot Truth Terminal tweeted the word in response to a post from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong (whose dog is named Russell). The bot did this after someone spammed it with the word "Russell," leading some observers to conclude the action was the work of traders who amassed a large RUSSELL position and then sold after a quick pop in the price. Andy Ayrey, the operator of Truth Terminal, took to X to confirm suspicions that the word "Russell" was spammed in Truth Terminal's mentions, pushing the AI bot to pick up and use the term.

Title: Here’s Where Crypto Billionaires Stand In The Election
Date: Oct 23, 2024,
Content:
A handful of billionaires with ties to the cryptocurrency industry have endorsed and donated to campaigns for former President Donald Trump—a former crypto critic whose family now operates a crypto platform—or Vice President Kamala Harris, as digital currency features as a growing factor ahead of Election Day. During an appearance at a cryptocurrency conference earlier this year, Trump said he wanted the U.S. ... [+] to become the “crypto capital of the planet.” Twins Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss—cofounders of the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini who are each worth $2.7 billion—said in June they had each donated about $1 million in bitcoin to support Trump’s campaign, with both brothers saying the Biden administration had “openly declared war against crypto,” and they have since reportedly donated a combined $10.1 million to political groups this cycle. Ripple cofounder and chairman Chris Larsen (worth about $3.1 billion according to Forbes’ estimates) endorsed Harris last week after having donated $1.9 million to support Harris through PACs and her campaign directly, according to CNBC, and he recently said he would donate $10 million worth of XRP—Ripple’s cryptocurrency—“in support of her.” Marc Andreessen ($1.8 billion), who runs the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz with Ben Horowitz, reportedly donated $2.5 million to Right For America, a super PAC supporting Trump’s campaign (Horowitz—who previously supported Trump—has since reversed his stance and said he would make a “significant” contribution to Harris’ campaign). Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban ($5.7 billion), who has invested in cryptocurrency projects at various points, has publicly supported Harris, though he has not donated to her campaign. Tim Draper ($2 billion), a founding partner of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, said last week he had donated “roughly equal amounts” to the Harris and Trump campaigns, saying he was “optimistic that either path will be a positive step” while endorsing both candidates.

Coinbase cofounders Brian Armstrong ($9.2 billion) and Fred Ehrsam ($2.7 billion) were the only two billionaires who each donated a maximum of $6,000 to Sen. JD Vance’s, R-Ohio, 2028 reelection campaign before he was announced as Trump’s running mate, Forbes reported. Jed McCaleb ($2.9 billion), who helped launch the crypto firms Mt. Gox, Ripple and Stellar, donated to a PAC calling for President Joe Biden to leave the race, indicating he was “very disappointed” in the Democratic Party at the time, according to the Washington Post. Mike Novogratz ($2.5 billion), CEO of the crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital Holdings, also called on Biden to drop out. Michael Saylor ($5.8 billion), founder of the business analytics firm MicroStrategy and an early Bitcoin investor, said Trump had taken a “very pro-crypto stance” while Democrats were “drifting to the middle” in their views of crypto and bitcoin. In 2019, Changpeng Zhao ($61.1 billion)—the Binance founder who later pleaded guilty to money laundering charges—told CNBC Trump had “not done anything positive or negative” for crypto, after Trump said he was “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tesla CEO Elon Musk (worth $245.9 billion) donated about $75 million to a super PAC supporting Trump’s election bid—America PAC—last quarter, and has become an outspoken Trump backer. Musk has spoken favorably about crypto at various points, and his comments on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies often result in market shifts, including a 20% jump in the price of bitcoin after he added “#bitcoin” to his X bio in 2021, though he has previously expressed criticism. Musk announced in 2021 Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment, saying he and the company were “concerned” about how bitcoin mining and transactions rely on fossil fuels while noting he believes “cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels.” Former crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried reportedly considered offering Trump $5 billion not to run for office. Author Michael Lewis said in his biography of Bankman-Fried, Going Infinite, the FTX founder had “somehow created a back channel to the Trump operation,” though it’s unclear why the deal didn’t pan out. Trump’s support of cryptocurrency has increased in the years since leaving the White House. In 2019, Trump said in a series of social posts he was not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, suggesting their values were “highly volatile and based on thin air.” During an interview with Fox News in 2021, Trump called bitcoin a “scam” and said he disliked the cryptocurrency because it’s “another currency competing against the dollar.” Since then, Trump has announced his support for bitcoin mining, called for the U.S. to become the “crypto capital of the planet” and has previously sold Trump-branded non-fungible tokens. About $3 million of his $6 billion fortune is invested in cryptocurrency as of Sept. 30, according to Forbes’ estimates. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump launched the cryptocurrency platform World Liberty Financial earlier this month and the platform has stated the Trump family will receive 75% of its net revenue. Harris reportedly said during a fundraiser in September she plans to “encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets.” Brian Nelson, a senior campaign adviser for Harris, told Bloomberg Harris would support policies that ensure the cryptocurrency industry “can continue to grow.” However, some crypto industry figures have criticized the Biden administration for its stricter approach to regulating cryptocurrency.

Title: Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Momentum Could Ignite for Repeat of 2021 – But Can It Beat This Viral Crypto? | Bitcoinist.com
Date: Date not available
Content:
Dogecoin (DOGE) is back in the spotlight as analysts are predicting a parabolic run just like in 2021. With strong community support and Elon’s endorsements Dogecoin (DOGE) is ready for another rally. But as Dogecoin (DOGE) tries to repeat 2021, DTX Exchange (DTX) is emerging as a new contender. Can DTX outshine Dogecoin in the next crypto wave? Dogecoin (DOGE) is at $0.13737 and down 1.54% in the last sessions.
Recent predictions say Dogecoin (DOGE) is about to have a big run. Crypto analyst Javon Marks is predicting Dogecoin (DOGE) will break its all-time high (ATH) of $0.73 and go to $3. That’s a 400% move based on Dogecoin’s past performance and market cycles. In the short term, Crypto Universe predicts Dogecoin (DOGE) will more than double to $0.37 in the next 2 weeks. That would be a new yearly high. After a brief pullback after the US elections, Dogecoin could resume its up move and go to $1 and even $3 as Javon Marks is predicting.
Dogecoin has already risen 15% in the last week and is now trading at $0.13. It’s the best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 40, with a market cap of over $20 billion​. One of the main drivers of Dogecoin’s recent price move is Elon Musk. Musk’s public comments have had a big impact on DOGE’s price, and his recent mention of “DOGE” (Department of Government Efficiency) at a public event helped to push the price up​. Musk’s involvement is still a big catalyst for Dogecoin’s growth, and rumors of Dogecoin (D.O.G.E) being integrated into X (formerly Twitter) as a payment option is fueling more interest in the cryptocurrency. Technically Dogecoin is looking very bullish. It’s in a breakout from a falling wedge pattern which means a 40% move by the end of 2024​. The wedge pattern is a reversal pattern from a downtrend to an uptrend so Dogecoin (DOGE) could see more gains in the coming months. Despite the technical setup investors should be cautious as the market is always volatile especially with big events like the US elections coming up. While Dogecoin (DOGE) looks good, DTX Exchange (DTX) is gaining momentum in the crypto space. DTX is a hybrid trading platform with 1000x leverage and KYC-free trading, attracting investors from established coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP).​ DTX has raised over $5.5 million in its presale and will reach $1 after its mainnet launch​. Some analysts are even predicting 50x returns for early investors by the end of 2024. DTX’s hybrid platform with decentralized and centralized exchange features is attractive to traders looking for high returns. The presale has already seen a 300% increase in token price so DTX Exchange (DTX) is a good alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE) for those looking for new opportunities. Dogecoin’s price prediction is looking strong and could see a big move in the near future. With Elon Musk’s backing and bullish technicals, Dogecoin (DOGE) could hit new highs. However, DTX Exchange (DTX) is a new option for those looking to increase DeFi’s growth. Dogecoin wants to repeat 2021 and DTX is the new contender with features that will attract a different crowd. Next few months will decide which one will lead the next big move. For more information, visit the Visit DTX Website, Buy Presale or Join The DTX Community.

This initiative not only highlights HTX's brand and strength but also deepens its cooperation with the Middle East's crypto community, providing a fresh impetus to the innovative applications of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies worldwide. Importantly, Justin Sun, founder of TRON and Global Advisor to HTX, earned the "Crypto Entrepreneur of the Year" award at Blockchain Life 2024, reflecting the summit's recognition of his exceptional achievements and innovative prowess in the blockchain field. During the summit, Edward Chen, Managing Partner of HTX Ventures, and Charmaine Lim, Head of VIP Client Services at HTX, were invited to participate in panel discussions, where they shared HTX's latest insights and industry expertise. Charmaine spoke at the roundtable discussion titled "Crypto Exchanges and Private Investors: Shaping Investment Strategies and Adapting to Market Trends." She emphasized that many investors overlook crucial aspects such as liquidity and market depth due to a lack of security awareness, often resulting in asset losses. Exchanges like HTX can help investors minimize the risk of errors by providing user education, intuitive interfaces, robust security measures, professional customer service, and regulatory compliance. Furthermore, she pointed out that investors can mitigate risks through portfolio diversification, particularly by allocating funds to a broad range of cryptocurrencies and DeFi platforms. In addition, Charmaine also noted that HTX will ensure all investors can execute trades effectively, even in highly volatile markets, by expanding the depth of the order book, utilizing price stabilization mechanisms such as algorithmic trading and risk management tools, and enhancing risk education for individual investors. During a roundtable discussion titled "The Unicorn Journey: Insights from Top Venture Capitalists", Edward shared his perspectives on the crypto market landscape and development trends for 2024. He is optimistic about four key areas that are currently noteworthy: CeDeFi (Centralized-Decentralized Finance), DeFi 2.0, the integration of AI and blockchain, and the convergence of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.  According to Edward, HTX Ventures is now focusing on pre-seed to Series A investments, particularly targeting early-stage projects. Their investment scope covers a wide spectrum of sectors, such as infrastructure, DeFi, DePin, SocialFi, GameFi, Layer 1 & 2, BTCFi, and AI. Beyond attractive valuations, HTX Ventures prioritizes business innovation, business models, operational capabilities, and team building as key pillars of its investment philosophy. As the Managing Partner of HTX Ventures, Edward was also invited to another global crypto summit in Dubai, the Cardano Summit 2024. In the roundtable discussion "Empowering Users: The Impact of Exchanges on Crypto Accessibility," Edward expressed his opinion that the blockchain landscape may undergo significant polarization in the future.  Based on Edward's view, three main factors are contributing to this phenomenon. First, as more exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enter the market, larger capital gains easier access to lucrative investment opportunities, further reinforcing existing wealth. Second, the influx of highly educated individuals with strong financial backgrounds into the blockchain space will lead to greater specialization. Third, large capital possesses a distinct advantage in the market, enabling it to leverage resources and information effectively. This advantage makes it easier for wealthy investors to generate higher returns, further widening the wealth gap. From Blockchain Life to the Cardano Summit, HTX and HTX Ventures have made frequent appearances in Dubai within a short period, underscoring their strategic positioning in the Middle Eastern crypto market and their commitment to developing the region's blockchain ecosystem. Through active participation in industry events and summits and by sharing insights on market trends and investment strategies, HTX seeks to foster innovation and application in crypto technology, thereby contributing to the building of a more accessible Web 3.0 ecosystem.

Title: Forex - Has Bitcoin Completed a Correction? | Crypto Review
Date: Date not available
Content:
Invest Responsibly: Trading CFDs involves significant risks. October 24, 2024 @ 11:30 +03:00    The cryptocurrency market has been rising since the start of the day on Thursday, recovering strongly from Wednesday’s late afternoon sell-off in the wake of global financial markets. At its lowest point, the market capitalisation was down to $2.23 trillion, and at the time of writing, it had risen to $2.32 trillion (+0.1% in 24 hours). The market’s intraday movements will reveal whether this marks the bears’ last stand or if the current rebound is just a bull trap. Bitcoin’s intraday dynamics are bullish. Wednesday’s end-of-day lows saw a flash drop below $65.5K, completing a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the 10-21 October rally. A quick exit to the recent highs at $69.5K would make the main scenario an extension of the upside with the potential to strengthen to $76K before further consolidation. According to CryptoQuant, 94% of the Bitcoin supply is ‘long’, with the median purchase price hovering around $55K.  Such high levels of unrealised profits have historically served as a precursor to significant BTC corrections. Retail demand for Bitcoin returned to pre-ATH levels in March. This contrasts with the first quarter when large players largely drove demand. Bernstein reiterated its prediction of a $200K price for the first cryptocurrency by the end of next year, calling it ‘conservative’. BTC’s investment appeal is increasing against the backdrop of rising US government debt and the threat of inflation.   The FxPro Analyst Team October 23, 2024 @ 12:02 +03:00 October 22, 2024 @ 11:20 +03:00 October 21, 2024 @ 11:50 +03:00 October 18, 2024 @ 16:45 +03:00

Title: Austria’s largest fraud trial sees five sentenced in connection to $21.6m crypto scam
Date: October 24, 2024 at 11:28 am
Content:

Share  An Austrian court has sentenced five individuals linked to the EXW-Token scam to prison, in one of the largest cryptocurrency fraud trials in the country’s history. According to a report from local media, the sentencing followed a year-long trial and 60 days of hearings where several individuals were found guilty of orchestrating a fraudulent scheme involving the EXW crypto token and the EXW Wallet. The accused allegedly promised victims high returns on investments in the fraudulent token that did not exist, while also promoting other ventures under the EXW brand including a real-estate business and a car rental service. Meanwhile, the EXW wallet, launched in 2019, was an elaborate MLM crypto Ponzi scheme that managed to dupe at least 40,000 investors out of 20 million euros (roughly $21.6 million.) The scheme promised returns of 0.1% to 0.32% per day. The scam eventually collapsed in 2020 but was allegedly rebooted and rebranded as Exchange World. The funds accrued by the bad actors were used to support an extravagant lifestyle which the report labelled as akin to something “straight out of a Hollywood movie.”  The defendants indulged in luxury cars, private jets, and lavish parties in high-end clubs in Dubai, and even decorated their homes with opulent items, including a villa with a shark tank and shoeboxes full of cash. The operation was based in Dubai and the accused allegedly moved some of the stolen cash to Austria. Based on their roles in the scheme, the Klagenfurt Regional Court has sentenced two of the defendants to five years in prison, while two others received sentences of 30 months, with 21 months suspended for a probationary period of three years. Another defendant was handed an 18-month suspended sentence. The defendants claimed they intended to run legitimate investment projects, but things got out of hand. The court, however, dismissed this, stating that the fraud was planned from the start, with no real profits intended. Benjamin Herzog and Pirmin Troger, two of the EXW wallet co-founders, had previously pleaded guilty to fraud in September 2023 and were each sentenced to five years in prison. Meanwhile, Manuel Batista, the third co-founder, remains in hiding. Cases of investment fraud using cryptocurrencies have become quite prevalent, with scammers exploiting the allure of high returns and the complexity of blockchain technology to deceive investors. Such schemes often involve fake projects, Ponzi-like structures, or misleading token offerings. Regulatory authorities worldwide are increasingly cracking down on such fraudulent activities to protect investors and maintain trust in the cryptocurrency market. On Oct. 22, a fraud trial was initiated in France targeting 20 individuals allegedly involved in a crypto scam that duped investors out of $30 million in the name of crypto investments. Just days before, an Indian national was sentenced to five years behind bars for stealing over $20 million from investors by spoofing crypto exchange Coinbase. In a separate case, a U.S. District Court ordered a promoter of the Forcount Ponzi scheme to pay over $3.6 million in restitution and serve a 240-month prison sentence. Despite the severity of these punishments, scammers show no signs of slowing down. According to an FBI report, frauds and scams involving cryptocurrencies and digital assets led to over $5.6 billion in losses in 2023 alone, marking a 45% hike from the year before. Elsewhere, the Irish national police force reported in August that over 45% of investment fraud cases in the country centered around cryptocurrencies.

			You could say that the only reason why Gitcoin is bullish now is because recently it produced a new All-Time Low. Imagine the new huge difference: a pair trading near its All-Time High and another one trading near its All-Time Low, opposite poles.

➖ GTCUSDT bottomed, hitting the lowest ever, 2-September 2024. We see some bullish action, like rising slowly for 8...
		 
			NVIDIA (NVDA) just produced a double-top and I shall explain why this situation right now is extremely bearish.

➢ First, the session that produced the new ATH closed red and two sessions earlier there was a bearish signal.

➢ Second, trading volume continues to decrease as a new high is hit.

➢ Third, NVDA is trading at resistance, the strongest resistance...
		 
			I look at the chart and I can see right away why some people think that it is already the end, that this is it, the end of the correction. I am here to warn you, to alert you, maybe even to shake you or wake you up, because this is only the beginning and not the end.

What we are seeing developing on the Bitcoin chart is a repeat of late July. What followed late...
		 
			I see five green weeks leading to a lower high (Doji) with decreasing volume each week and then the action turning red. This is happening after dogwifhat (WIFUSDT) peaked in late March 2024. So the five green weeks after a rounded bottom counts as an inverted correction which is over, and once a correction is over we get an impulse.

The initial and main move is...
		 
			My friend, how are you feeling?

I hope you are feeling good. If you are reading this, it is likely that you are so I would like to welcome you. Welcome to this another beautiful day.

It is good that we have time to read because if we can read, we can trade.

Trade might be a big word because what we do is something much easier with our method, it is just buy and...
		 
			Cartesi hit bottom...

My friend, it is my pleasure to write again for you.

➖ CTSIBTC hit the lowest price since February 2021. Needless to say, the support range that contains this price level launched the 2021 major bull-run, are we setting ourselves up for the same? Yes!

➖ Cartesi just hit bottom and I can tell because of the 'volume breakout' and strong...
		 
			Is there still time for the Ethereum SHORT? Should I share the full trade-numbers?

Absolutely... The bearish consolidation pattern remains intact and the market just created an opportunity for an even better entry than what we had just a few days ago.

Please, just keep in mind that things can always change and this can turn into a failed trade. But it can also...
		 
			Warning, close any and all LONGs on Notcoin (NOTUSDT) as it is going to be diving down searching for new lows. Bitcoin is bearish now and the entire Cryptocurrency market is turning bearish to produce the final correction low.

There is only one last support and this support is very likely to break, once it breaks, expect much lower prices.

The good news is that...
		 
			The DXY is at its most bullish since June 2021. Here we can see it bouncing strongly from EMA55 as support.

We looked at the DXY and how it is related to Bitcoin ( see here ).
Now we want to consider the DXY on its own.

➖ How far up can the DXY go and for how long?

To start, we can see that the last time the DXY went bullish it closed green for four consecutive...
		 
			I would like to call your attention to the sessions/candles of April and November 2021, both followed the same pattern we are witnessing now, in October 2024.

➖ April 2021 started green, we saw prices moving higher and by the end of the month a bearish bias developed and the session ended red. A strong correction followed and this signaled the orthodox end of the...
		 
			We already looked at XRP based on the long-term, we continue positive for 2025 and we are definitely going to see some amazing growth next year.

We already looked at XRP short-term, but what about the mid-term.

Let's detach for a minute and look at this weekly chart. XRPUSDT has been bearish in many ways since July 2023. 

Where is this bearish action leading...
		 
			We are seeing a rejection, in the exact same faction as it happened back in late July...

Good afternoon my fellow XRP trader, I hope you are having a wonderful new Moon day.

The same price range, resistance, that produced 'rejection 1' is also producing 'rejection 2'. This is very interesting.

MA200 was there in the way last time but XRPUSDT cut through it...
		 
			I believe I shared a bullish analysis for Dogecoin recently. If you read this analysis, this is an important update.

The recent jump reached its end and it seems to be a failed bullish move. Dogecoin found resistance around the same level that led to the 5-August crash. For DOGEUSDT this high happened 21-July around 0.14300. This is shown with a blue line on the...
		 
			Bitcoin produced an inverted correction from 5-August until 21-October and hit as high as $69,500, right below the $70,000 level from which the 29-July major crash developed. Ethereum on the other hand remains super weak.

Ethereum's weakness reveals a bigger bearish bias across the Cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum's latest pull-back produced a minor recovery...
		 
			Hello my cherished reader, it is my pleasure to write and be of service to you again today.

We are going to be looking at the DXY long-term, weekly timeframe. We will consider how the action is happening in relation to MA200 and then reach some conclusions in relation to Bitcoin, are you ready? Good!

In June 2018 the DXY moves above MA200, the black line on the...
		 
			Bitcoin not only failed to breach the $70,000 - $71,000 price range resistance, it didn't even reach it. Just as there was a very strong rejection on the 29th of July when Bitcoin moved above 70K, this time we are seeing very strong selling right at $69,500, below 70K. Lower high confirmed.

How are you feeling today my wonderful supporter?
I hope you are having a...
		 
			My friends... My dear reader, how are you feeling today?
I hope you are having a wonderful week.

Here I am mapping the "next move"; Actually, I am mapping the "current move."
This is what is going on now, what I see happening now; short-term.

Things can change in a flash, sometimes.
Sometimes everything changes suddenly but this is the exception, not the...
		 
			Since we are expecting a drop, let's look at Bitcoin's different support levels based on different high and lows and extraction methods.

➢ In relation to the up-move between 5-August and 21-October, the following levels show up as the most relevant:

1) $56,879

Title: Pundit Says Solana and Ethereum Will Outdo Bitcoin on a Donald Trump Win
Date: October 24, 2024
Content:
[ccpw id="39382"] Date:  Written By:   Follow Us On Seasoned market pundit and Asgard Market’s partner Alex Kruger has asserted that altcoins like Ethereum and Solana are the trades to take in the case of a Donald Trump win. Speaking at the Bits and Bips podcast, the popular economist noted that the “Trump trade” is not Bitcoin but altcoins. He sees Solana and Ethereum outperforming crypto’s firstborn, Bitcoin, if the Republican nominee wins the November election. Popular market consensus believes that crypto would do better under Trump than with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Brokerage firm Bernstein predicted that Bitcoin would trade at $90,000 if pro-crypto Trump wins and $30,000 if Harris emerges victorious. With that established, Kruger believes that altcoins will outpace Bitcoin’s strides with Trump’s win. He noted that he would prefer to bet on Solana and Ethereum over the largest crypto asset by market cap. Notably, the duo has performed differently in the current market scenario following Bitcoin’s short-lived push to $69,000. For context, Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum, with the ETH/BTC pair hitting a 42-month low of 0.03772.  https://x.com/thecryptobasic Also, Bitcoin has grown 5.10% in the past month, while Ether has performed conversely with a 4.62% depreciation. However, Solana has mirrored Kruger’s assertions, outgrowing Bitcoin substantially. The fifth-largest crypto asset has outperformed Bitcoin’s monthly performance by three folds, with its latest surge above $170. It bears mentioning that Standard Chartered’s head of digital asset research, Geoff Kendrick, shares a correlating assertion with the Asgard partner. The market expert predicted Solana and Ethereum would outgrow Bitcoin if Trump wins. Kendrick speculated a fivefold surge in Solana, a fourfold uptick in Ethereum, and twofold returns for Bitcoin. Notably, he expects the likely approval of the Solana spot exchange-traded funds under Trump to catalyze the asset’s fivefold bullish uptrend. Meanwhile, Kruger recently asserted that Solana would flip Ethereum’s market cap in the near future. In another Bits and Bips episode, he noted that he is long-term bullish on the SOL/ETH pair. The market expert also noted that Solana has all it takes to overtake Ethereum, and he believes in its feasibility. He said that Solana has “nothing to prove“ and has “everything they need to make it happen.” Notably, Kruger is not the first to pick Solana over Ethereum. Multi-billion asset manager VanEck stated in a September report that Solana was superior to the second-largest crypto asset and sees the “Ethereum killer” reaching half its market cap. For context, half of Ethereum’s current market cap is $151 billion, a 75% uptick from Solana’s $86 billion. Notably, a surge of that magnitude will push Solana to $300 per coin.
